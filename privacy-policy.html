We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES</h3>
<p>We keep our privacy policy under regular review.</p>

<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

<h3>THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h3>
<p>This Website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications.

We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our Website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>

<h3>THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>
<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, and date of birth.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes billing address, email address, and telephone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Data</strong> includes bank account and payment card details.</li>

</ul>

<p>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We generally do not generally collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses. However, we may collect this type of data if you voluntarily provide it to us through surveys, sign-up forms, or other methods. Any Special Category data provided will be used solely for the purpose stated at the time of collection and will be stored and processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws and our privacy principles.</p>

<h3>IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. This could impact services or subscriptions. If this is the case, we will notify you.</p>

<h3>HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?</h3>
<p>We collect data from and about you through:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct interactions:</strong> This includes Identity, Contact, and Financial Data that you may provide by filling in forms, corresponding with us by post, phone, email, or otherwise. This may occur when you apply for our services or subscriptions, create an account on our Website, request marketing materials, enter a competition, participate in a survey, or give us feedback or contact us.</li>
<li><strong>Automated technologies or interactions:</strong> As you interact with our Website, we automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites using our cookies. For further details, please see our cookie policy <a href="#">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>We only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We most commonly use your personal data:</p>

<ul>
<li>To perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that we don’t typically rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, although we will get your consent before sending third-party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. Remember, you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.</p>

<h3>PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>We have provided a table below that outlines all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified our legitimate interests where appropriate.</p>

<p>Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table.</p>

<h3>PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US</h3>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, and Profile Data to determine what we think you may want or need, or what may interest you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you.</p>
