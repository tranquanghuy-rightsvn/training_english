<strong>How a Graphics Card Works<br></strong><br>
</div>
<div>When you run a game or any application that requires graphical processing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) sends data to the GPU. The GPU then processes this data, performing calculations to render images, textures, and effects. The processed data is stored in the VRAM, and the GPU continuously updates the display with the rendered images. This process happens at an incredibly fast rate, often measured in frames per second (FPS), to ensure smooth and fluid visuals.<br><br>
</div>
<div>The GPU is designed to handle parallel processing, meaning it can perform multiple calculations simultaneously. This capability is crucial for rendering complex scenes in real-time, such as those found in modern video games. The more powerful the GPU, the more efficiently it can handle these tasks, resulting in higher frame rates, better image quality, and a more immersive gaming experience.<br><br>
