    "content":  "There are some people who differentiate between habits and skills, I don't. With a skill, you typically have ways of improving the performance over time. So, you want there to be a good habit basis for a skill. And obviously when you start something new, you have to be making decisions and exerting willpower. Only over time will you start to automate- it can take thousands of repetitions before you can do it, habitually, automatically in a high-level, very accomplished way. <br><br>I think that when you start out learning a skill, that you're often starting out doing it thoughtfully in a very deliberate way. But over time that conscious thought becomes much less important. All you have to do is pick up the tennis racket and hold it, and you know what to do with the ball. There's not a whole lot of conscious deliberation that has to be automatic. I got to talk to a professional cellist about what it's like to play a piece of music in front of an audience. <br><br>I mean, the melodies are beautiful, they carry you along, but there's still so much to remember. And it turns out they set cues throughout a piece. So they will practice a piece in segments, and then if someone coughs in the audience, there's some disruption, some other musician forgets where they are, they can go back to that cue; that they can then just pick up from and continue. And it's beautifully seamless. Malcolm Gladwell has a book out arguing that, with enough practice, we can all be successful at a high level in almost any domain. He's right, that practice is beneficial, but geez- it takes a whole lot more. <br><br>As an athlete, you need a certain set of physical abilities. To be a great musician, you need other kinds of capabilities. You can get a whole lot better at skills if you keep practicing them. But whether you will be able to reach high-level, elite status, that's less certain because that's a combination of innate skills, certain types of training, opportunities, who you get to work with. I mean, all of these things matter, and it's not just based on practice. Our second self-our habits develop as a consequence, as a function of the opportunities that we have. Of the choices that we have in our lives.",

    "content": "TYLER COWEN: Let's try crypto without water - but we'll see.<br><br>NEWSCASTERS: 'Crypto.' 'Crypto.' 'Crypto.' 'Cryptocurrency becomes more popular, we're starting to see signs that it could become part of our financial future.'<br><br>COWEN: Cryptocurrency is a truly new idea, and it's rare that we have truly, fundamentally new ideas. Think of Bitcoin as a kind of record keeping system, and you pay people in Bitcoin to validate the records, and you move on to the next day and every day, every moment, you have a new set of records - and this process is self-enforcing. It cannot easily be overruled by an outside authority or central authority. So it's like you have, at the same time, potentially a new kind of money, a new kind of investment asset, and also, actually, a new kind of computer. <br><br>So when I talk to people who are deeply into crypto, I often feel quite skeptical. They have such bold, grand plans, and I'm not convinced they've thought through how to carry it all out. At the same time, I know many people who dismiss crypto altogether. They think it's a scam or a bubble or a fraud. And when I talk to them, I feel quite bullish about crypto. I see a lot of potential in the ideas, but I don't think we know yet how useful crypto will be.<br><br>Here are some reasons why the crypto-skeptics are skeptical: People use crypto to pay off ransoms. Let's say hackers will go into the medical records of a hospital, pull out or lock or freeze that information, and they won't give it back until they're paid off in crypto. You can't ever get your money back. It's an irreversible transaction done on the blockchain. That's the end of it.<br><br>Crypto itself, in most of its current forms, it consumes a lot of energy. You have computers racing to make calculations to crack different kinds of cryptographic problems. And those computers use so much energy that it damages the environment through carbon emissions in a way that we understand pretty well now.<br><br>But maybe the biggest reason to be crypto-skeptical is simply that a lot of the promised benefits haven't happened yet. \"Well, it's gonna make banking cheaper.\" \"It's gonna make finance cheaper.\" \"It's gonna make lending cheaper.\" Maybe those dreams are just impossible, or impossible anytime soon. And if people are skeptical about the promised benefits of crypto, they have some good reasons to be skeptical.<br><br> Here's a way to think about 'the bullish case' for crypto: Imagine that the internet becomes more and more its own economy with its own series of rules, and that economy is a global one. It will need its own systems of record keeping, its own systems of property rights, its own way of consummating transactions. We'll need a new institution to do all those things, and crypto is actually the best bet that we have. If that occurs, and many people think it will, it probably would be possible for me, say, to take part of my checking account and just by sending a single message, lend some of it out to say, farmers in Kenya. The world would be more global. I would be better off. They would be better off. There'd be this new system, some call it the 'Metaverse,' others just call it the 'expanded internet,' where we would own more things on the internet, have these secure property rights validated by the blockchain, have new investment assets, and moving resources around the world would be much easier, cheaper.<br><br>That is speculative, but it is not what I would call \"crazy speculative.\" It's a possibility, and we're going to see if that's what's going to happen.",

    "content": "ETHAN KROSS: I think chatter is one of the big problems we face as a species. We spend between one-third and one-half of our waking hours not living in the present. And what do we do during that time? We're talking to ourselves. Your inner voice is your ability to silently use language to reflect on your life. Chatter refers to the dark side of the inner voice. When we turn our attention inward to make sense of our problems, we don't end up finding solutions. We end up ruminating, worrying, catastrophizing. We get stuck in a negative cycle that takes this remarkable tool that we possess, this inner voice, and it turns it into a curse rather than a blessing. <br><br>My name's Ethan Kross, I'm a professor of psychology and management, and I'm the author of the book, \"Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It.\" <br><br>In terms of whether there's an evolutionary purpose to the inner voice, many scientists believe that language is a tool that helps us navigate the world, and our ability to use language not only to communicate with others, but to communicate with ourselves, provides us with a survival advantage. It's an incredible problem-solving device. At the most basic end of the spectrum, our inner voice is part of what we call our 'Verbal Working Memory System.' It's a basic feature of the human mind that helps us keep verbal information active in our heads. Our inner voice also lets us simulate and plan. <br><br>So before a big presentation, I'll go over in my head what I'm gonna say, what are the different talking points that I'm gonna run through- I'll hear what questions the audience is gonna ask me, and then I'll respond in turn. I'm simulating that exchange, and I'm using my inner voice to help me do that. Our inner voice helps us control ourselves. Think about the last time you may have wanted to reach for a treat late at night, but then you think to yourself, \"Don't do it, you'll regret it in the morning.\" That's your inner voice. And then finally, the inner voice helps us 'storify' our lives. <br><br>Many of us turn our attention inward to come up with some narrative that explains our experiences in ways that give shape to our understanding of who we are, our identity. So sometimes this inner voice can be an incredible source of help, but at other times it can really sink us. First, it makes it incredibly hard for us to focus. Chatter consumes our attention. Chatter can also create friction in your relationships because you're talking about your problems over and over again, and not being a great listener to others. It can also make us more irritable, and lead to something called 'displaced aggression.' Finally, we know that chatter can have severe, negative, physical health effects. You've probably heard that stress kills- that's not exactly true. <br><br>A stress response is a really adaptive response. What makes stress toxic is when it remains chronically-elevated over time. This is precisely what chatter does. We experience a stressor in our life, it then ends, but in our minds our chatter perpetuates it. We keep thinking about that event over and over and over again. And that keeps that stress response active in ways that can predict things like cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation, and even cancer. <br><br>It's hard to overstate how negative the implications of chatter can be. The good news is there is a science-based toolkit that you can use to regain control of your inner voice. There are things we can do on our own, ways of harnessing our relationships with other people, and even ways of interacting with physical environments. One really great example of these tools are rituals. We love having control. When you experience chatter, you often feel like your thoughts are in control of you. <br><br>One of the things that we've learned through science is that we can compensate for this feeling out of control by creating order around us- rituals are one way to do that. A ritual is an ordered sequence of behaviors that you rigidly perform the same way each time by engaging the same sequence of behaviors every time the same way. That's giving you a sense of order and control. That can feel really good when you're mired in chatter. <br><br>The tennis great, Rafael Nadal, he said the hardest thing that he struggles to do on the tennis court is manage the voices inside his head. He engages in rituals. During breaks between play he goes over to his bench. First, he takes a sip out of one water bottle. Then he takes a sip out of another. Then he puts each water bottle back exactly where he picked them up from on a diagonal to the court. It's a ritual he does to manage his chatter. <br><br>There are no individual tools that work for all people in all situations to help manage your chatter. Instead, the real challenge is to figure out what are the unique combinations of tools that work best for you? Are you weaker for experiencing chatter? Absolutely not. You are human for experiencing chatter, so welcome to the human condition.<br><br>NARRATOR: To learn even more from the world's biggest thinkers, get Big Think+ for your business.",

    "content": "ZENA HITZ: We're kind of enchanted by a mystique, a sort of Hollywood picture of an intellectual. That film \"A Beautiful Mind\" is a perfect example. You have this mathematician, he's a genius. He sees things no one else can see. He's in a class apart. He's not like you and me. And I think that that's a distortion of what an intellectual really is. Whereas the real thing is something more extraordinary but also more available to us.<br><br>Hi, I'm Zena Hitz. I'm a college professor. I teach at St. John's College in Annapolis, and the title of my book is \"Lost in Thought: The Hidden Pleasures of an Intellectual Life.\" I was a very successful academic for a time, looked to be at the beginning of a very accomplished career and it felt somehow off to me. I had a kind of an early midlife crisis. Quit the profession entirely and lived in a monastery, a Catholic religious community. I wanted to figure out what intellectual life really was. What is this practice of reading and studying and thinking?<br><br>Aristotle is a philosopher who I've studied a lot and spent some time with. He thought there was a danger of our lives becoming totally focused on these telic activities, acting as a means to an end. And the way he puts it is: Work is for the sake of leisure, not the other way around. We have a tendency to get locked into this mode where we're acting for the sake of something else without ever getting the something else. So part of what my work is trying to do is to ask people to reflect on what the something else is. What's the thing that all of your busy-ness and all your activity is really for? What are the moments that really matter to you? Where you feel like this is the point, this is why I'm doing what I'm doing. Without those things, our lives I think are pointless. What interests me is an intellectual life that's not acquisitive, that's not trying to get anything else but just wants to be doing what it's doing. It looks like things that are really pretty ordinary to most of us: reading, thinking, speculating about people's motivations in life, what makes people tick. Bird-watching, walking in nature. It's something that belongs to you in a certain way that's private. It's a part of yourself that really in principle no one has access to.<br><br>Someone like Albert Einstein who has that huge profile who has the mystique of the genius, who has the puffy hair. But if you think of him as a young man in his late '20s with a wife and a kid and no job, because he's too weird and he's too disrespectful with authority. He can't get work. And he has this job in a patent office. He's a bureaucrat. And he thinks about things. He looks at the clock tower. He looks at trains going by and he starts to really have insights into the way the world is. And he calls, in a letter he writes later in life, he calls the patent office, \"the worldly cloister where he hatched all his most beautiful ideas.\" And it's where he wrote these three 1905 papers which were totally transformative for physics. Despite being denied a place in the world that he aspired to, he was able to find this space where he could be who he was and think about what he wanted to. For some time we haven't been accustomed to thinking that way about learning or about intellectual life. That it's something which has to do with the attitude of the individual to what they're doing...",

I mean, look at all the problems right now- it makes the most sense either ethically, or from a climate change perspective, not to do it.\" Things are really bad right now in a moment-to-moment level: be it climate change, be it race or economic justice, and a host of other issues. But, if we actually step back and don't look at the headlines or the breaking news alerts about how bad things are, and look at things from a hundred-year or even a thousand-year perspective, where we are as a species right now is amazing in terms of science, technology, morality, values. Having children, in many ways, is a radical act of hope and courage for a better tomorrow.<br><br>Homo sapiens have been making short and long-term decisions for a very long time. Yes, we built the Panama Canal, we built the transcontinental railroad, we did the Marshall Plan. At the same time, we would create laws and ways of being that would deal with the injustices of 400 years past, by actually doing things that were very short-termistic, that we are still dealing with today. So what we do is we develop these 'sandbag strategies,' which means it works well enough. It doesn't deal with the underlying issue that you built a house in a flood plane or that we're going to see more refugees fleeing because of climate change. It means we're just dealing with it in the here and the now. And then when we actually don't deal with these short-term things that we've done these sandbag strategies, we see that we are going to be dealing with them in multitudes at an exponential level for decades to come. <br><br>That being said, moving us forward as a species doesn't mean giving up. It doesn't mean going up a dark mountain, and pulling down the shades, and saying, \"That's it.\" There's still so much more for us to do, and one of the ways of doing that is actually perpetuating our species and having us move forward. If I think about my dad, who was born in the 1920s, who survived the Holocaust and moved forward, having seen what he saw, the worst of humanity, he still went ahead and had a family. He had children. There are some rough times ahead. What we do now matters, and one of those things is having radical hope and having awe towards what tomorrow could be. One way of doing that is having children. I'm not saying it's going to be perfect. It wasn't perfect for me, it wasn't perfect for my dad. But every year that moves forward, the arc towards progress actually does bend towards a better tomorrow. <br><br>The best thing you can do for your kids right now is not create a 'Shangri-La' picture of what they're going to be going into, but giving them the tools to be better humans so that they themselves are setting themselves up to be great ancestors to future descendants. So for our kids, they will be moving through a time that will be in some ways difficult, in some ways easier, but it's going to be more magnificent than anything we've ever known because we are consistently seeing us as a species pushing ourselves more forward when it comes to the morals that we need to be the great ancestors of future needs.",

Well, congratulations, you're a human being. We all experience conflict in our lives, and seeing what's going on in our world today, my hunch is you were probably having at least one of these conflicts about politics. Our country has fallen into what I believe is a tribal trap.

Let's start with identity.<br><br>BLACK & WHITE FILM: Now, first of all, this is a hot issue.<br><br>SHAPIRO: Why do we get so emotional in these conflict situations? It often goes back to something deeper: identity. What are the core values, the core beliefs that are feeling threatened inside of you as you're having that conversation with the other side? The moment your identity gets hooked in these conflicts, all of a sudden your emotions become 100 times more powerful. Boy, this is a wholly different conflict now. It's now your pride. Your sense of self is on the line. <br><br>You need to know who you are and what you stand for. What are the values and beliefs that are driving me to fight for this stance on this issue? The more you understand who you are, the more you can try to get your purpose met and stay balanced, even when the other threatens those core values and beliefs. Each side wants to feel appreciated, and yet the last thing they want to do is to appreciate the other side. That's a problem.<br><br>BLACK & WHITE FILM: Listen and understand.<br><br>SHAPIRO: When you're in the midst of the conflict, don't talk. Take the first 10 minutes. Consciously listen to the other side. What's the value behind their perspective? What's the logic, the rationale? Why do they hold this perspective on immigration or healthcare? Once you truly understand and see the value in their perspective, let them know I hear where you're coming from, and you know what? That makes sense. There is nothing more in the world that we like than to feel appreciated. Recognize your power to appreciate them.<br><br>Third, affiliation. What's the emotional connection like between you and the other side? We typically approach these conflict situations as me versus you. My opinion on healthcare versus yours, my party's perspectives on immigration versus yours. That's just gonna leave the two of you like rams butting heads.<br><br>BLACK & WHITE FILM: Find common ground.<br><br>SHAPIRO: Turn that other person from an adversary into a partner, so it's no longer me versus you, but the two of us facing the same shared problem. Ask the other person, \"Look, what's your advice on how we can get as many of our interests met at the same time?\" Change the nature of your conversation. <br><br>Now, you put these three things into practice, it can transform your relationships. Imagine what would happen if we started a revolution, but a positive revolution of greater understanding, greater appreciation, greater affiliation, how we could transform politics, how we could transform our country and ultimately our world. I believe it's possible, but it starts with each one of us.",
