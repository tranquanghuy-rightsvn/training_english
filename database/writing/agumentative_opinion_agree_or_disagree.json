    "contents": [ "Nowadays, there is a significant number of products made from animals like food or clothes can be replaced by other modern way. Although I agree with this trend, I also argue that we still need animal products to some extent.<br><br>On the one hand, it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer. To begin with, animals are used to be the major sources of materials to produce the outfit, until now some wealthy people in many developed countries still use skin of animals for making their clothes. However, this is the modern century, so there are a huge of materials can replace the animals’ skin. Furthermore, the meat like the chickens, beefs, porks can replace by the plant and vegetable. It provides sufficient nutrients for our body and can also help us prevent from a substantial number of problems such as the high blood pressure, cardiovascular and really good for our eyes. For example, carrot contains a lot of vitamin A and can prevent people from myopia.<br><br>On the other hand, animal testing has played an essential role in the medical fields. With the development of technology, we can replace animal experiment with the computer programs that could provide a significant number of results. However, finished drug must be inspected by testing animals like hamsters before giving to patients for safety. For instance, animal testing has so far saved many patients the virus diseases by finding suitable vaccines. <br><br>To sum up, people should stop experimenting on the animal and find some other new medicals by technology.",
     "Recently, there is a rising belief that animals' food and products will be no longer essential in humans’ daily demands. From my perspective, I totally support this viewpoint since humans can totally limit or even eliminate our reliance on these products by eating vegetables and choose non-animal-related clothes or medicines.<br><br>Firstly, one of the preponderant reasons to stop animal exploitation is that human beings, as omnivores, do not need to consume as much meat as we do now. In fact, the human does not need to eat animals to survive, and we can still stay healthy by having vegetarian diets. An impressive example that we can raise to support this point is Indian cuisines. This country is famous for its cuisine, which largely uses vegetarians, such as tomatoes, onions, or chickpeas. In their culture, a minimal amount of meats are used for cooking; however, this practice does not make Indians less healthy than people worldwide.  <br><br>Secondly, even though human beings have a long history of using animal products like clothes or medicine, these habits can be eliminated throughout if we commit to it. The reason is that our modern technology has developed significantly and be able to provide non-related animal products with the same effectiveness. Taking medicine as an example, in the past, Vietnamese traditional doctors often used various animal parts, like heart or bones, to allegedly cure different maladies. However, these days, the same elements in medicines can be extracted from herbs or chemical reactions in drug factories. Therefore, we do not have to exploit innocent animals for our own benefits cruelly. <br><br>In conclusion, under views of the above viewpoints, I argue that human beings have to eliminate our animals' product usage since we can use alternative ways like becoming vegetarian and choose to use plant-based or chemical-based medicines"

    "contents": [ "Some people opine that people can do away with traditional libraries because technology has given us the facility of virtual or online libraries. Although technology has reduced our need to go to the libraries, traditional libraries can never become redundant and maintaining them is not a waste of money.  <br><br>On the one hand, it can be a waste of money to keep libraries open. The advent of new technologies like computers and the Internet has transformed traditional libraries from venues containing a large number of printed documents into paperless libraries containing only digitized documents. This has led to the creation of virtual libraries in which the user has access to information at any time and anywhere in the world by using the modern tools of communications, such as computers and Internet facilities. Therefore, it is unnecessary to spend money on traditional libraries because fewer and fewer users use them.  <br><br>However, libraries still play an important role these days. Firstly, a person goes to a library not only to search and get information from books but also to sit and study there. The peaceful and scholarly ambiance of the library helps one to concentrate more on one's work and study. Secondly, virtual libraries can be accessed only by those who are computer literate. For elderly or disadvantaged individuals who rarely have a chance to be exposed to cutting-edge technologies like computers or smartphones, it is much more challenging to access information online than going to a traditional library.  <br><br>In conclusion, advancement should be welcomed in every field but the importance of the libraries for their fundamental role cannot be put aside, and funding them is not wasting financial resources.  ",
     "Nowadays, public libraries have less convenient than computer technology so people are borrowing books from libraries which are lower in the past, but I strongly agree that maintaining public libraries is not beneficial ways for people or government.<br><br>First of all, most people have less time to borrow books at the library because computer technology has developed to easily for people who are busy to find a research from books. As a result, the number of visitors had lowest and there is some high cost of expenses such as electricity, staff members’ salary or the rent of the space. In addition, Schools or Universities have changed methods to teach by using computers, tablets or e-books because teachers can send information from a website on the internet, sending to students before or after the classroom so some can download and read any content in their smart phone that they want. Finally, some books or magazines might be boring and not engaging for people due to the internet have more interesting and easier to find such as BBC online or Bangkok Post online.<br><br>However, public libraries have some advantages for children or adults, especially some families have not computer access with internet that is available for students because the computer is very expensive and they may not be able to afford at home. Moreover, the books and magazines in the library are guaranteed by written so it can reduce some misinformation from research.<br><br>To sum up, computer technology has more usefulness for this modern era, so it is comfortable for people to save time, flexibility or abundant options to read."

    "contents": [ "There has been significant discourse surrounding the proposal for scientific research to be conducted by governments rather than private entities. While some would argue the opposite on the grounds that it engenders greater innovation, I contend that governments can conduct better research as they are less susceptible to corporate influence.<br><br>Admittedly, there have been cases where privately funded scientific research has stimulated innovation. Individuals who conduct research on the behalf of commercial interests are typically encouraged to think creatively in developing new solutions to pervasive problems. For instance, SpaceX is a for-profit corporation that is leading its competitors in terms of innovating space travel. Founded and managed by tech magnate Elon Musk, it has introduced new solutions to existing problems in space transportation such as reducing production costs on their rockets by using 3D printing technology and mass production methods. Furthermore, SpaceX has pioneered the utilization of reusable rockets as half of them have flown more than once with little to no refurbishment. From this case, it can be understood why some argue commercial entities should be in charge of conducting scientific research.<br><br>However, the case for governments conducting scientific research is stronger. With private companies conducting such research, they are more predisposed to financial incentives since they are primarily driven to boost profits. In contrast, governments conduct scientific research often with the altruistic aim of finding solutions to various societal problems in their respective nations. To cite an example, a private medical firm in Ghana was tasked with conducting research and producing 600,000 doses of their own COVID-19 vaccine. However, these doses did not meet WHO standards after testing as a result of the research process being rushed to maximize profits. It was only when the Ghanian government intervened to replace the previously made doses with their own newly certified products that the public finally felt at ease.<br><br>In conclusion, although privately sponsored scientific research has an important place thanks to the competition that drives innovation, I believe that government sponsored research exerts a more positive impact on society and the public good. In the near future, it can be predicted that the scientific community will be able to welcome more scientific breakthroughs thanks to the funding of the state",
     "Nowadays, it is often argued that the authorities should play the predominant role in  conducting  and managing scientific research rather than private enterprises. Personally, I totally agree with this belief and will provide my opinion in the essay below.<br><br>Firstly, the financial capacity of any private business can hardly  equal  that of governmental institutions. Consequently, if the enormous state funding is properly  expended  on costly scientific projects, a larger quantity of equipment and facilities can be provided for government researchers, which would considerably  facilitate  their scientific research. <br><br>Secondly, there is often  an element of openness and transparency  within governmental scientific projects. Specifically, these research pieces are usually funded by public resources and expected to be made publicly available for  independent verification  and  replication of results . Therefore, the state research outcomes tend to be significantly accurate and objective.<br><br>Finally, not only do governments focus on the research outcomes but they also have to be highly aware of any potential risks and dangers caused to the environment or even the researchers’ health, such as the  disposal of noxious chemical samples  or use of  toxic radioactive substances  in laboratories. By contrast, for economic benefits, private companies tend to  put substantial emphasis on  the final results  in the absence of  numerous safety measures to protect the ecological and human factors.<br><br>To recapitulate briefly, I am totally in favor of the idea that scientific research should  be put in the hands of  governmental corporations instead of private ones for their better financial capacity, transparency and awareness of possible damage."

    "title": "The only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "contents": [ "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about measures to ensure road safety. However, whether imposing stricter penalties for driving offenses is the only way to protect people is still a controversial issue. Although I agree that harsher punishments can act as an effective way to deter people from committing road offenses, I believe that there are better methods to protect the welfare of road users.<br><br>Firstly, it is obvious that the implementation of rules can act as a deterrent to would-be lawbreakers. For example, in Vietnam, a motorist not wearing helmet can be fined with $20 to $40, and thus he will be in fear of facing further punishment and avoid committing another offense. Furthermore, more stringent punishments for traffic crimes can be an efficient way to reduce traffic accidents. For instance, in the past, China witnessed a significant number of annual road casualties when it had very loosely enforced regulations. However, once harsher laws related to road safety were implemented in 2009, there was a notable reduction in the total number of traffic accidents.<br><br>This is not to say that only by using stricter rules can we enhance the safety of our roads. It is true that there are still other effective measures to ensure people’s safety, such as heightening people’s awareness through the media about the consequences of committing driving offenses, or promoting the use of public transport systems such as buses or trains. To achieve the best results, the most effective method may be to combine all the aforementioned ideas.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that stricter punishments are not the only way to deal with minimizing driving offenses. Measures, including raising people’s awareness and promoting the use of public transport systems, can also contribute to maintaining road safety.",
     "Careless driving and violation of traffic rules certainly result in a large number of accidents. Although it is argued that the only solution to reduce them is to strictly punish reckless drivers, I believe that there are other measures that are equally effective in ensuring road safety.  <br><br>In the first place, there are certain accidents that occur not because of traffic violations. To explain it further, poor road conditions are considered a major reason for road casualties. For example, narrow roads and sharp curves often force even law-abiding drivers to make mistakes. Therefore, it should be noted that drivers alone cannot be blamed for such mishaps, and giving them stricter punishments in these cases is no solution. A more effective strategy by the government would be to straighten accident prone-curves and widen narrow roads. A larger number of road signs and proper traffic signals can also be effective in reducing accidents on roads.   <br><br>Furthermore, poor climate conditions can be a major cause of accidents. For instance, poor visibility due to dense mist and rain, and slippery roads on account of snowfall make driving difficult and cause serious accidents in many countries. Stricter punishment for drivers is a futile exercise in handling such problems. Modern technological innovations on cars' wheels or on-road designs should be used to deal with such emergency situations. On the other hand, reckless driving, speeding, and breaches of traffic rules by careless drivers have caused many accidents. Moreover, drunken and drowsy driving has also resulted in serious traffic mishaps. While more stringent punishment for drivers would be an effective measure to an extent, it should not be considered the only way towards road safety.  <br><br>In summary, there are certain situations where drivers are not responsible for a particular accident, so apart from punishing drivers with heavier penalties other effective measures should also be taken.

    "contents": [ "Globally, educating the younger generation is more significant as compared to an illiterate adult. While many people hold the view that the government should invest its resources in educating  older people, I vehemently disagree with that position. This essay will discuss the benefits of  investing in the education of the younger population and the demerits of prioritising educating the adult. <br><br>Firstly, if the state directs its resources on the youths it will yield tremendous fruits. This is because, at this age, they can give their best output in terms of their studies. These younger folks are not distracted by family or job-related stress and they mostly do their best in order to succeed academically whilst the adult in most cases would be occupied with family issues and they tend not to concentrate on their studies.  To illustrate, my dad went to school at age 40, by then, he had my elder sibling and I and I can reminiscence that he used to leave school to take me to the clinic whenever I was ill. However, I am of the opinion that authority spending its monies on adult schooling will be a detriment to its economy.   <br><br>Moreover, the youths find it easier to learn and comprehend new skills and ideas whilst it is difficult if not impossible for grown-ups to cope with learning as it is said, \"it is challenging for an old dog to be taught a new trick\". For instance, when I was in grade 5, I had a classmate who was 28 years old and  could not memorise the multiplication from 2 to 12. In that regard, I strongly believe that government should not use its resources to educate the uneducated grown-ups but instead utilise them for the education of the young.  <br><br>In conclusion, other jurisdictions prefer to empower their youths educationally than  adults.  Also, I do disagree with the views of several people that the government should embark on educating the adult. Despite there might be some truth in it, however, if the government did such a thing, in my estimation it will be a catastrophe for its nation.",
     "Education is an inevitable factor in life and most of the countries following the same in the case of young people but in the fact of adults who do not know writing and reading some people believe that authorities should spend more money on their education. However, I totally agree with the statement and explain the reasons in the following essay.<br><br>Firstly, the unliterary people are facing many problems due to the improper knowledge of examine and writing. For example, when they go for their different needs they want to depend on others to help them translate the data. Also, to fill the forms or applications for various situations like the hospital, bank, and all. Therefore, it creates a lot of issues when always required the support of others. Moreover, to find a job basic education is a must. Particularly, for communication as well as knowledge.<br><br>In addition to that, when traveling from one place to another at least to read the name board of the place reading accuracy should be necessary. On the other hand, uneducation maybe not be their mistake may it caused due to their circumstances. For instance, in the early days, the education facilities and financial background are not much stronger than now. Hence, it might lose the chance for their academic. Furthermore, right now if the government helps them to learn minimum basic education as free it will provide good support and future for the uneducated adult people. <br><br>To conclude, living without dependency even in writing and reading is essential. So, authorities should take maximum measurements for that. Not only does it help them to live independently but also gives an option for opportunities."

    "contents": [ "There can be little doubt that in recent decades a lot of time and money has been spent on protecting wild animals. Although spending on protecting these kinds of wild animals can sometimes be beneficial to humans, I would argue that it is of higher importance to allocate these resources to the human population.  <br><br>On the one hand, it is reasonable to provide financial support for wildlife protections. In fact, by saving wild animals, humans are saving themselves. Wild animals, for instance, may hold the keys to certain medical breakthroughs, just as many modern medicines are based on compounds found in plants. Moreover, humans, animals and other forms of life all form a giant ecosystem whereby each part can influence the others. If a certain animal becomes less common, this, in turn, will reduce the population of the animals that prey on it, which is more likely to disrupt the ecological balance and eventually threatens the survival of human society.<br><br>However, it is sometimes difficult for people to accept that these perfectly legitimate reasons outweigh the immediate requirements of the human population. If money is not available to people who have problems such as mental illness, physical disabilities or to those living in dire poverty, it is inevitable that some will suggest spending less on wild animals. There is a strong argument that by spending more on the education of humans, we could make the world a better place for us and for wild animals.  <br><br>Overall, I tend to agree with those who claim that too much money is currently being spent on wild animals at the cost of humans. This is not to suggest that we cut all funding for wildlife projects since many of these projects can directly benefit humans. However, a key argument for me is that by spending money on people, we can improve the world generally. ",
     "There are those who opine that the immense amount of attention and money that are being spent for wildlife conservation should be allocated to the human population. I totally disagree with this idea because of the advantages provided by animals, humans’ responsibility to solve the environmental impacts, and biodiversity preservation.<br><br>First of all, I believe that we should protect animals because of the benefits that they bring to us. For example, lambs have provided food and clothing for humans for centuries, while mice are used for medical experiments such as finding vaccines against deadly diseases such as HIV. Therefore, it is worthwhile to spend money for animal conservation in order to keep the benefits continuing. In addition, it is humans’ responsibility to ease the environmental problems caused by their activities. This is because the natural habitats of wild animals such as forests are being exploited to serve the exponential growth of human population, thereby putting many of them on the verge of extinction.<br><br>Another point is that animal species need to be protected in order to maintain biodiversity. This is because without this biodiversity the whole planet suffers threats including people. For instance, rain forests and animals depend upon each other as mutual interdependence is a must for their survival. The forests provide shelter for animals and they make oxygen for the animals to live. When animals die they decompose and become natural fertilizer for plants in the forests. Therefore, the disappearance of animals can pose a risk to rain forests which are crucial for human survival as they produce oxygen and prevent the threat of climate change.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that wildlife conservation is imperative to be allocated considerable resources to because this can maintain the benefits of animal species to humans, solve environmental problems resulting from people’s activities and prevent the biodiversity from being destroyed."

    "title": "Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories, and their employees to the countryside. Do you agree or disagree?",
    "contents": [ "Increased traffic and lack of housing supply are major concerns in many places. By relocating large businesses, including their factories and employees, to rural areas, these issues can be properly addressed. I personally find this idea justifiable; however, at the same time, some other initiatives should be implemented if we expect to solve traffic and housing problems effectively.<br><br>Moving businesses and their facilities to the countryside will cause urban population to shrink substantially as successful companies, such as Apple, provide work for thousands of people. This, as a result, will relieve pressure on urban housing supply systems. Another apparent advantage of a decreased population is lower volumes of traffic which help reduce traffic congestion. In Hanoi for example, most people travel to work by private vehicles, and this leads to overcrowded roads during the rush hour. If big companies are based in a rural area and offer accommodation to their employees near their workplaces, this will no longer be the case.<br><br> Nonetheless, I think the mentioned problems are rather complicated and can only be solved completely by the introduction of some other measures. One example involves the development of road systems because narrow roads largely contribute to traffic jams in major cities. Building wider roads and motorways will allow a greater number of vehicles, both private and public, and therefore reduce traffic congestion. Also, residential areas with small living spaces that can accommodate a growing population should be established in urban centers.<br><br>In conclusion, I agree that relocating businesses to the countryside is one way to deal with traffic and housing problems. I also believe that we need a combination of this approach and a number of other actions, as listed above, to tackle these problems in a more comprehensive manner.",
     "A proposition has been put forth suggesting that the predicaments of traffic and housing shortages could be ameliorated through the relocation of significant corporate entities, manufacturing plants, and their respective workforce to rural territories. I strongly concur with this notion, as it promises to alleviate the congestion of urban centres, stemming from the reduced number of commuters on the roads, and an augmented inventory of residential accommodations.<br><br>To commence, routing employees to rural areas would alleviate traffic congestion by curtailing the number of daily commuters using various modes of transportation. The concentration of a significant workforce within city limits serves as a principal factor leading to traffic congestion. Therefore, directing employees to countryside locales would relieve the metropolis of this problem. For instance, London experiences peak-hour traffic during morning and evening rush hours, primarily due to employees commuting to and from their workplaces. Moreover, relocating to the countryside would provide city migrants with a chance to improve their quality of life by enjoying spacious living quarters and fresh air, a luxury that is often unattainable for city dwellers.<br><br>When it comes to housing, the issue of availability is often exacerbated by the high demand for rental properties, which is largely driven by the employees of significant corporations and manufacturing facilities. When these employees are relocated to rural areas, the demand for housing in urban centres decreases, resulting in a surplus of available flats. Thus, as more companies and their workforce are encouraged to relocate to the countryside, it can alleviate the housing crisis in cities by creating more housing opportunities for those in need. Milan, a city in Italy, serves as an example of how relocating companies and their employees to rural areas can mitigate housing shortages in urban centres. Milan encouraged companies to relocate their operations to the rural parts of the region, thereby freeing up more housing for residents in need. <br><br> To conclude, transferring businesses and their workforce out of the city is a plausible strategy to mitigate traffic and housing challenges, as it would decentralize industrial operations and distribute the burden between the city and countryside."

    "contents": [ "It is common that the news media is often covered by problems and suffering. Although I agree with the idea that this trend adversely impacts individuals and society, I think that its advantages should be mentioned.<br><br>First, we should admit that the news on emergencies can save lives and reduce damage especially during natural disasters. The media often reports the emergent news on storm attacks or earthquakes, for example, or the state of emergency often is declared via the media to concerned audiences. In doing so, people being in danger can take corresponding actions to stay safe right away. Second, news reports on criminals and punishments can play a role in educating the public about justice, or it might deter people from committing crime, or people can know how to protect themselves from crime.<br><br>However, I think that when the news is filled with social issues and emergencies, it sometimes does more harm than good. The detailed description of crimes can help criminals as a source of training to break the law. Moreover, the media sometimes exaggerates the real threat of emergencies or dramatises criminal incidents in pursuit of drawing the public’s attention and increasing audience ratings, thereby generating higher profit from advertising. This means that many people have been living in fear and panic of crime or danger because of the misleading information from the media.<br><br>In conclusion, media reports on problems and emergencies can be informative for those who might be concerned, but the disadvantages are much stronger if the media focus too much on reporting those stories.",
     "The question of whether emergencies or positive stories should be featured on the news have been a recent topic of debate. Many believe we should try to focus on issues and situations of negative stories, whilst others believe that constant exposure to darker content on the news would cause people to turn away from news altogether. Personally, I believe that the news should maintain a balance of both positive and negative stories.   <br><br>On the one hand, depressing or upsetting news might turn people away from watching them entirely, leading to a large contingent of people being under-informed. This is something cable news and traditional print media have failed to solve, as they prefer to maintain a pessimistic, sensationalist style of reporting in order to increase revenue. As a result, there has also been a recent sharp increase in, for example, the number of American youths who get their news through comedic news shows, as an effort to offset the gravity of the situations we are faced with every day.   <br><br>On the other hand, it can be argued that focusing on ignoring negative issues will not make them go away, and informing the people of their existence might lead to better solutions. Countries and societies constantly need to change to adapt to pressing problems, and only by informing its citizens and involving them in the decision making process can solutions be found. For example, the prospect of a climate catastrophe is gloomy, however, if there was no coverage on it, it could be judged that there would not have been as many environmental movements as there are today.  <br><br>In conclusion, I argue that news outlets have a delicate balance to strike -  they must achieve their goal of remaining objectively informative, whilst also presenting an image of the world that does not negatively affect their viewers<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "Museums and art galleries have played a major role in preserving and conveying historical values for a long time. While many people suggest that they should focus purely on displaying works that represent the nation’s culture and history, others with contradicting views affirm that international works are also of great worth. Personally, I think both viewpoints are equally valid.<br><br>On the one hand, there are reasons why it is believed that artifacts and works of national value should be given priority. Firstly, museums and art galleries should be places that honor indigenous history and culture. By going to these museums and galleries, people will gain a deeper understanding of their nation, along with the golden ages and hard times that the country has been through. The exhibitions therefore serve an educational purpose as they instill patriotism and promote a sense of national pride in the citizens of that country. Apart from that, such places also help to preserve traditional and historical values. In the 21st century, many minority ethnic groups are in grave danger of losing their culture, and therefore, the display of their works and artifacts will help to preserve their culture and the cultural diversity of a nation.<br><br>On the other hand, showing international works of art has several merits. Works from other parts of the world help to diversify the content of museums and art galleries. Admittedly, even though the value of museums and art galleries cannot be denied, their failure in adopting changes and updating collections has discouraged people from visiting these places. For that reason, international works will add appeal and aid museums and galleries in attracting more visitors. Furthermore, if museums display international works, people will have more chance to gain knowledge and insight into other cultures as well.<br><br>In conclusion, the ultimate goal of museums and galleries is to spread knowledge and wonder far and wide. Therefore, my suggestion is that local artifacts and works should be prioritized, while those of other nations can still be exhibited but in separate museums and galleries.",
    "Museums and art galleries play an important role in offering multifaceted knowledge to the public. Some individuals opine that these institutions should primarily focus on their local history and art instead of global works of art. However, I disagree with this viewpoint as international works provide various benefits to the public.  <br><br>Museums and art galleries offer a medium for understanding cultural heritage. By focusing on local history and art only, such institutions limit the knowledge of the public to the domestic borders. Conversely, if art and history from other parts of the world are displayed, museums and art galleries exhibit multiculturalism, allowing people to understand distinct histories and cultures, and thus, enhancing globalization. For example, the Vatican museum exhibits works from several European countries, allowing the smallest country in the world to be a bridge to explaining cultural values of distinct nations under one roof.<br><br>Moreover, international historical and cultural works would allow individuals to gain information on critical international issues that many countries face together. Many museums choose to have educational international exhibitions of important political and social issues, which may be more informative than the media. For instance, the War Remnants Museum in Vietnam has collections from across the country and globe in order to depict thoughts on poverty, war, and trade, and in a survey, 88% of visitors declared that they felt more informed about such issues from the museum than from the news.  <br><br>In conclusion, I disagree to a large extent with the belief that museums and art galleries should focus on the history and art of their own country rather than international works, as with the latter, these museums, and galleries build a platform for globalization and multinational knowledge."

Some believe that a larger portion of government funds should be dedicated to teaching science-related. In my opinion, although science plays a large role, other subjects hold merit in their own right in contributing to, and in driving, economic progress and therefore, deserve equal government investment and funding.<br><br>On the one hand, public funding in science education subjects is important in driving the development of a country in many areas, such as engineering and medicine. For example, developed countries such as Japan has emphasised the science education of their citizens. This strong focus has led to science learning, knowledge, and scientific research achievement fosters innovation and increases productivity, which directly contributes to the national economic growth of the nation. Therefore, investment in the teaching of science education is crucial for a country’s economic progress.<br><br>On the other hand, the management of the nation also determines its state of development and economic progress. As such, it can be argued that curriculum subjects such as social sciences and law require as much attention and investment. For example, developing economies such as Indonesia and Cambodia have long experienced a history of political and social unrests and conflicts. We can largely attribute this to instability and poor management of legal, social and governmental systems. This is in contrast to their Asian counterparts such as Singapore and Korea, where well-established and stable civil law and political institutions can be observed.<br><br>In conclusion, subjects related to the management of a nation’s economy such as social sciences have as much impact and significance on the development and progress of one’s nation and deserve as much government investment as science sub<br><br>", 
    "How to allocate government’s expenditure has long been a highly charged issue. While 1 accept that there should be an increase in state funds for imparting science-related knowledge, 1 would argue that other subjects are of similar significance in the progression of a nation.<br><br>On the one hand, placing a premium on science subjects like mathematics and physics is conducive to the growth of a nation. It stands to reason that the more researchers or engineers a country has, the greater is their contribution to the prosperity of a society. To illustrate, with billions of dollars spent for scientific researches and relevant leaching activities, America has accomplished a number of breakthroughs in road networks, biotechnology and space exploration. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that stressing the role of science subjects in the education system would have a far-reaching long-term impact on a nation.<br><br>On the other hand, I believe that liberal arts education including literature and law has an equally important role to play in the sustainable growth of a nation. It is widely acknowledged that a society characterized by citizens well-cultivated and knowledgeable in literature or arts tend to enjoy a higher moral standard and social stability. Specifically, law-abiding and productive citizens tend to adopt decent code of conduct and commit fewer crimes, leading to better social security and improved living standards.

    "contents": [ "In the light of the current rise in the number of obese people, some suggest that increasing the price of high-fat foods can be an effective solution. I mostly agree with this suggestion given the fact that it holds the potential to decrease the consumption of these foods although it may fail to tackle the factor regarding inactive lifestyles that contribute to obesity.<br><br>My first rationale is that an increase in the price of fatty foods can demotivate potential customers. It is true that many buyers are sensitive to changes in prices, thus an increase in the cost of fat-laden options is likely to discourage their purchase. This price surge will prompt individuals to reduce the frequency and quantity of their purchases, reducing the overall consumption and eventually the likelihood of obesity.<br><br>Additional reasoning for my support of the price increase is that a major contributor to the rise in the consumption of fattening dishes is the appealing advertising campaigns. These are often run by restaurants and other food providers to boost their sales. However, the drop in consumption resulting from the rise in product prices will make these businesses less profitable, forcing them to cut down their budget on these campaigns. Consequently, with fewer advertisements promoting high-fat foods, less people will be tempted into buying and consuming them.<br><br>However, I concede that higher prices for affected foods might not be an ultimately effective solution to the issue of obesity. This is primarily due to the fact that people can still become obese when consuming less fatty foods, if they embrace the sedentary lifestyle which involves a minimum amount of physical activity that helps burn the excess fat in their body.<br><br>In conclusion, I mostly agree with the idea of raising the prices of fatty foods to address the problem of obesity. The increased prices will effectively discourage consumers from making purchases and lead food companies to reduce their advertising efforts for such foods; however, this solution does not address another cause of obesity which is the lack of physical activity in daily life. Therefore, a comprehensive measure would be increasing high-fat foods’ prices while concurrently encouraging people to engage in regular physical exer<br><br>",
    "There could be said to be an increasing number of individuals who are becoming obese. Recent policy decisions have proposed that a price hike on fattening foods be implemented in order to dissuade people from consuming them and thereby curbing the obesity epidemic. I personally think that while this measure might help, it would not be nearly as effective as other measures such as portion control.  <br><br>Whilst there is no doubt in my mind that making fattening sugary foods more expensive would certainly curb the rise in obesity, it is still uncertain that it would necessarily be as effective as we might expect due to the price inelasticity of fast food products. Some might state the law of supply and demand as a reason why we might expect sugary food consumption to decrease when prices rise, but behavioral economics might propose that people would be more than eager to hand over more money for the fattening foods that they enjoy. This is why other addictive substances such as cigarettes, for example, have also been shown to be somewhat immune to price increases.  <br><br>Furthermore, a larger issue may actually be portion control, as having larger portions in each meal could actually encourage people to eat more. Particularly in fast food chains, food portions are exorbitantly large leading to each meal being calorically higher than normal meals. If portions are decreased for every meal, even if the price is lowered, it could lead to people consuming less calories per meal and thus becoming less obese. Studies have shown that by making bowls smaller, for example, individuals also consume less food. If governments apply this method to fast food restaurants, it could potentially decrease obesity rates more effectively than price hikes could.  <br><br>Overall, I argue that whilst increasing the price of fattening foods might help to a degree, I argue that other options such as portion control might be more effe<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "The world health care system has been facing enormous pressure due to frequent outbreaks of diseases. It is argued that the state should increase their spending on raising the citizens’ awareness of a healthy way of living rather on providing timely treatments when the diseases have occurred.<br><br>Without question, “prevention is better than cure”, therefore the government should have policies in making its people adopt a healthy lifestyle. Through national and local awareness enhancement campaigns, people can be better informed of potential health risks associated with their bad habits. For example, instead of consuming too much fast food on a daily basis, teenagers or busy workers will therefore choose more nutritious foods or try to cook by themselves, which can prevent the high incidence of obesity, diabetes and other fatal diseases.<br><br>In addition to their long-term positive effects on people’s frame of mind, such campaigns are cost-effective. What needed is budget on conveying messages on the mass media like television, newspapers or conducting various workshops to share advice and experience to the public. By contrast, the medical treatment fees for a single patient with cancer disease like liver or lung cancer can amount to dozens of millions or billions, meaning a huge financial burden to the state and the family.<br><br>However, the government cannot ignore its obligation in improving their medical system as well as assisting the already ill patients covering their medical fees. The hospital fees are so expensive in some countries that only the rich can afford, so the government’s role in offering aid for treating the sick is a moral duty. As well as this, constructing more hospitals and buying modern equipment should also be put into consideration as it is more effective in the short run.<br><br>In conclusion, raising the level of public awareness is more important, but the government cannot neglect its concern on the supply of medical treatment for those currently being ill.",
     "Governments should emphasize on funding in a healthy lifestyle instead of investing revenue on medicines to prevent the prevailing dangerous diseases of patients. I, partially, agree with this viewpoint, because giving a healthy life of citizens is equally as important as healing of serious patients.<br><br>To begin with, it is true preventing of any kinds of ailments must be the first priority of citizens as well as authorities. This is because governments have to provide  the least amount of money, if they make aware of the public regarding the serious consequences of unhealthy habits. For example, children and older people would like to eat whatever and wherever they want, so that diseases, like weight problems, and obesity occurs. As a result, they suffer from health-related issues which abstain them from thinking about their career. For that reason, increasing awareness among young and senior citizens ,not only provide them a healthy and balanced lifestyle, but it also reduces the cost of authorities in supplying costly medicines and other treatment instruments for patients.<br><br>In contrast, at present, there are lots of fatal diseases such as AIDS, and different other cancers, which are impossible to cure for the common people. The reason is that for healing such perilous ailments, people need a huge amount of money. Taking into consideration, governments should come forward with helping hand for those patients who are struggling for money, if it would have, they would be free from these diseases. Moreover, governments must separate some revenue for building hospitals, buying the latest equipment for operation theatre, and medicines for curing HIV, and cancers to minimize the expense that generally goes to the public if it is not provided.<br><br>In conclusion, it is a controversial issue about whether governments invest money on maintaining better lifestyle, or, whether they should provide funding  for removing the existing  severe diseases. From my perspective, the authorities of nations ought to focus on both good lifestyle and curing diseases."

    "contents": [ "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about measures to ensure road safety. However, whether imposing stricter penalties for driving offenses is the only way to protect people is still a controversial issue. Although I agree that harsher punishments can act as an effective way to deter people from committing road offenses, I believe that there are better methods to protect the welfare of road users.<br><br>Firstly, it is obvious that the implementation of rules can act as a deterrent to would-be lawbreakers. For example, in Vietnam, a motorist not wearing helmet can be fined with $20 to $40, and thus he will be in fear of facing further punishment and avoid committing another offense. Furthermore, more stringent punishments for traffic crimes can be an efficient way to reduce traffic accidents. For instance, in the past, China witnessed a significant number of annual road casualties when it had very loosely enforced regulations. However, once harsher laws related to road safety were implemented in 2009, there was a notable reduction in the total number of traffic accidents.<br><br>This is not to say that only by using stricter rules can we enhance the safety of our roads. It is true that there are still other effective measures to ensure people’s safety, such as heightening people’s awareness through the media about the consequences of committing driving offenses, or promoting the use of public transport systems such as buses or trains. To achieve the best results, the most effective method may be to combine all the aforementioned ideas.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that stricter punishments are not the only way to deal with minimizing driving offenses. Measures, including raising people’s awareness and promoting the use of public transport systems, can also contribute to maintaining road safety.",
     "Road accidents have always been a significant matter of concern, so much so that there is an idea that says the problem can only be solved by punishing driving offenders very strictly. However, I do not think this is the only solution, although it could be somewhat effective.<br><br>On the one hand, it could be helpful to apply serious penalties to reduce the risk of traffic accidents. Theoretically, this not only can prevent lawbreakers from driving thoughtlessly again but also can warn other people against doing that. For example, since 2019, when Vietnam laid down strict legislation on alcohol consumption control, the number of crashes caused by drunkenness has decreased. According to this law, drivers will receive a fine of at least 85 USD for motorcycles and 255 USD for cars if their blood or breath contains alcohol, besides having their driving licence confiscated.<br><br>On the other hand, the above-mentioned solution is not always successful, hence an alternate measure should be proposed. Research conducted in Queensland, Australia, in 2019 shows that traffic infringements did not decrease despite the imposition of serious penalties, suggesting that people’s aggressive driving habits were not successfully deterred. Therefore, another measure is needed, and from my perspective, we ought to think about banning private vehicles, at least in a number of areas. This not only contributes to the reduction of road accident risks but also helps to ease environmental problems.<br><br>In brief, imposing strict punishments on driving offences could be helpful, but only to a certain extent. Since this method cannot defeat reckless driving, another proposal ought to be made, such as prohibiting personal vehicle<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "People have different views regarding the importance of a building’s function in comparison to its exterior appearance. In my opinion, I agree with the idea that a construction’s purpose should be more highly valued than the appearance for a number of reasons.<br><br>On the one hand, it cannot be denied that a magnificent looking structure can bring a wide range of benefits that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, it can remarkably raise the value of a building, especially a commercial or shopping center, as it looks more attractive, professional and high-class. The more customers are attracted to the building, the more profit it can potentially generate, which can benefit the building’s owners enormously. Secondly, a building with an aesthetic design can contribute a lot to the appearance of a city, and may make it become one of the most distinguishing places on the map. A lot of cities nowadays which are well-known for their architectural beauty have become popular destinations for tourists.<br><br>On the other hand, the purpose of a building, in my opinion, is the key consideration when designing it. There are a variety of different building types such as office buildings, commercial buildings, shopping centers, hospitals and schools. Each one of these has its own purpose and a particular interior design to serve those purposes. Therefore, only by focusing on the functionality of a design first, can we bring out the best use of a construction. In addition, people use a particular place because of what it offers inside, not merely because of what it looks like on the outside. For example, if a company intends to erect a new office building, they will tend to choose the design based on the inner working spaces to enhance the operation of the staff and the enterprise.<br><br>In conclusion, while the exterior of a building is an important factor, I believe its function should receive greater atte<br><br>",
     "Some individuals opine that the most vital aspect when designing a building is its function rather than its outer aesthetics. I somewhat agree with this viewpoint as although a good-looking building enhances the beauty of its surroundings, without meeting its basic function, it would be a waste.<br><br>On the one hand, a building with an appealing appearance may be a source of beautification of its locality that may encourage people to visit it as it may serve as an incentive for tourism, leisure, or work. For example, the bathhouses of Brighton are well-known for their bright and colourful designs and promote tourism in the state of Victoria. Similarly, attractive university campuses and office spaces are deemed to be popular study and work destinations among young adults.<br><br>However, the function of a building is of pivotal importance when considering its design. A building needs to accommodate the needs of its owners, residents, and patrons. Specifically, one basic necessity of any building is safety; that is, it needs to be sturdy and durable. However, nowadays, there are many fashionable styles of buildings that compromise their stability and safety. For example, in India, an architectural firm gained popularity for its one-of-a-kind designs and, a few years later, the designs were claimed as unsafe when many of the buildings collapsed during a minor earthquake. As a result, several resources were wasted, and many lives were endangered in light of the importance given to the outward appearance of the buildings over their basic functionality.<br><br>In conclusion, I agree to some extent that the purpose of a building is of utmost importance instead of the external aspects when designing it, as without serving the primary functions, a building would be a waste of essential resources and even<br><br>"

While I accept that children will gain a range of benefits when studying literature works of their own culture, I also believe that learning foreign literature is equally important.<br><br>On the one hand, learning literature from local resources gives children the opportunity to learn more about their own traditional and historical heritage. Take Su tich banh chung banh day as an example. This fairy tale helps kids to know more about the main purpose of Tet holiday and how people celebrated Tet in the past. In addition, literature works such as folktales, poems or stories help develop children’s patriotism. By studying Thanh Giong, for example, children have the chance to learn about how their ancestors went through various challenges and even sacrificed themselves for the independence of Vietnam. This helps remind them that they have to make every possible effort in everything they do in order to contribute to the development of their country.<br><br>On the other hand, I believe that teaching children literature of other nations is equally important. Foreign literature books provide kids with in-depth knowledge about cultural and traditional values of different parts of the world. This can help them to avoid culture shock or other culture-related problems when they travel abroad or work for an international company in the future. Another reason is that by learning literature from both local and foreign resources, children would be able to think from different perspectives when encountering a problem. This helps develop better decision-making and problem-solving skills.<br><br>In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I personally believe that it is necessary for children to learn both local and foreign literature.",
     "It is argued by some people that local literature is of greater importance in children’s education compared to foreign literature. From my perspective, I disagree with this view since both types of literature play equal roles in the development of children.<br><br>On the one hand, locally written works come with numerous benefits to students. Firstly, these pieces of art can enrich student’s skills to use their own language. Indeed, through learning literature of their mother tongue, students can learn the art of using the language such as the flexibility in the vocabulary highlights used, the syntax of sentences, and different ways to convey ideas. Hence, linguistic knowledge will gradually be built up and benefit the students not only in their study but also in social communication. Secondly, national literary works give students an insight into their own culture. For example, through traditional literature, namely fairy tales, legends and fables, students can become familiar with their traditions, native terms and also national values which have been passed down from generation to generation. As a result, they will naturally develop a sense of national identity and patriotism.<br><br>On the other hand, studying foreign literature is also advantageous for the following reasons. To begin with, it gives learners opportunities to expand their horizons by showing them a bigger picture of the outside world. Having access to foreign historical events and cultures, commentaries on politics, society, and stereotypes in literature from countries abroad will foster students’ awareness of the diversity of the world. Additionally, the students will be equipped with a broader range of knowledge to help them be more prepared for the globalized world that we are living in today. To be more specific, the students will have a grasp of the culture of foreign countries and how to adapt themselves in terms of manners, customs or behaviours if they live in that new environment or dealing with foreigners.<br><br>In conclusion, it seems to me that there is a need to teach both local and foreign literature at schools so that students can develop comprehensively."

This is because arts can teach us certain things about life that we cannot learn from science and technology.<br><br>Firstly, arts give us the opportunity to see things from a different perspective. In the world of science and technology, we see things as the way they are; yet, in the world of arts, we are allowed to use our imagination and creativity to see things the way we want. In a researcher’s eyes, for example, a cat is just an animal with soft fur and four legs; however, a cat, to a writer, could be a friend, a hero or a traditional symbol of a culture. This way of seeing things helps us to gain deeper insights into the world we live in and teaches us to think from different perspectives when encountering problems.<br><br>Another point about the benefits of arts is that while scientific and technological developments bring benefits to our physical lives, arts instill religious and spiritual values into each individual, which helps us to become a more well-rounded person. For instance, whenever I felt down and depressed, I often listen to the song called You raise me up which always gives me the feeling that I can do anything that I have a passion for as long as I put my heart into it. I think we hardly ever have this feeling when we carry out a scientific research or a technological project.<br><br>In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I believe that in the world of arts we can learn various things that are absent from the world of science and technology.",
    "In this modern era of nonstop scientific and technological advancement, artists still command profound respect from people the world over. There are a number of things about life that arts can teach us whilst science and technology fail to do so.<br><br>Many forms of art, especially literature, can deliver messages about the appreciation of what we have in life as well as life itself. Hundreds of literary works choose to depict misery, misfortune and sorrow that still exist in many places, and this sends the strongest message to those who do not appreciate their lives. “The Goldfinch”, for example, which narrates a resonant story about the miserable life the main character led after the unfortunate death of his mother does make each one of us wonder whether we have become heartless toward our own loved ones. And I doubt that there are any technologies in the world that could manage to convey such powerful messages.<br><br>Arts teach us to cherish the beauty of culture and are the fuel for our spiritual lives. This is extremely important in a world where science and technology seem to fade our belief in the gravity of culture in daily life. The connection between arts and culture is here to stay, and traditional music and ancient paintings can remind us of where we came from and who we are at present. That is to say, our cultural identity is preserved in various forms of arts.<br><br>Although science and technology advance our understanding of all things and better our lives, arts can touch us to a much deeper extent, help us value what we have, and remind us of the significance of our culture."

Psychologically, this type of news, unless managed properly, may keep readers in a state of stress and lead them to experience trauma.

Also, frequent exposure to negative news can distort readers’ perception of reality. In Vietnam for example, it seems that members of the media do not focus on keeping the public informed of current events anymore, both locally and globally.

In the high-raised super malls, myriads of objects buy and sell to customers, whereas one type of item is sold in small shops. From my perspective, having large shopping malls and tiny shops, both have a negative and positive advancement for its economic growth.<br><br>To begin with, most of the local shops are changing into larger shopping malls for the convenience of customers. The reason is that vendors get various types of goods at a time if they shop from shopping malls or chain shops. For example, shopping malls have lots of departmental stores that are filled with various types of objects such as grocery, electronic equipment, clothing, et Cetra. Customers buy everything without any hassles which save their time since they do not need transports to move from buying different things. Moreover, large shopping malls often discount on purchasing items, consequently, save the money of clients. Besides, people can reach any kind of shop, as all the shops are located in a building. Thus, building a huge shopping mall benefits consumers and owners, but destroys the business of local shops.<br><br>In contrast, small shops are ubiquitous in each country. As a result, customers find it difficult to search for their desired-items which could be expensive and limited in the variety of designs. For instance, in Dhaka, there are lots of hawkers where people will not get different items from one shop. Hence, consumers need to go to  The Multi-Plan, a shop of electronic goods, while if people demand clothes, they ought to go to the Newmarket. It is very tiresome work to reach the local shop in Dhaka because transports are always stuck in the street due to traffic congestion. Eventually, people not only lose time, but also become tired of shopping. Although sometimes people get items at a low-price and different from a big department store, the quality of items is cheap. Besides, locally earned profit helps in the economic growth of the local area and its population.<br><br>In conclusion, the mammoth shopping malls grasp local shops. It has both a positive and negative development that impacts the lives of common people and society. In my opinion, it is good to have a big shopping mall as well as a small shop due to its influence on the pecuniary growth in society.",
    "In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend where large shopping malls are gradually replacing small, local shops in many urban areas. This phenomenon has sparked a debate regarding whether it is a positive or negative development. In my opinion, while there are advantages to both types of retail establishments, the shift towards large shopping malls has more negative implications for society as a whole.<br><br>One of the primary benefits of large shopping malls is the convenience they offer. These malls typically house a wide range of stores, restaurants, and entertainment options all under one roof. Shoppers can find everything they need in one place, saving time and effort. Additionally, malls often have ample parking and are easily accessible by public transportation, further enhancing their appeal.<br><br>However, the convenience of large shopping malls comes at a cost. Small, local shops, which are often family-owned businesses, struggle to compete with the resources and marketing power of these giants. As a result, many of these small businesses are forced to close their doors, leading to job losses and a decline in the uniqueness and character of neighborhoods. Furthermore, the shift towards large malls can lead to a homogenization of products and services, as these malls tend to host the same chain stores, thus limiting consumer choices.<br><br>Another downside of large shopping malls is their environmental impact. These megastructures consume vast amounts of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, contributing to environmental degradation. Moreover, the need for large parking lots and the increased traffic generated by malls can exacerbate urban congestion and pollution.<br><br>In conclusion, while large shopping malls offer convenience and a variety of choices, the overall impact on society is negative. The displacement of small, local businesses, environmental concerns, and the potential loss of community identity make it a less favorable development. It is essential to strike a balance between the two types of retail establishments to ensure that both can coexist harmoniously in our urban landscapes."

While I accept that teachers may have more influence on the intelligence of their pupils, I would argue that parents probably exert a greater influence on the social development of their children.<br><br>In terms of encouraging intellectual development and stimulating the intelligence of school children, I believe that teachers play the major role. While not all teachers are capable of inspiring their students, they are trained to impart their knowledge of their subject areas in challenging and imaginative ways.

I personally disagree that parents have less influence on their children's intelligence and social development than teachers and the essay will discuss about my view.<br><br>To begin with, parents are their children's primary care givers and will spend many times with their children; therefore, children will have more chances to learn from them automatically. During school time, children go to school to obtain knowledge by learning different kinds of subjects; however, what they learn are all from text books or labs and after school, parents are their mentors in their daily lives and teach their children a variety of thinking skills. For example, children with good parents' support and guiding will do better at schools and have good careers in their future. Moreover, high intelligence is inherited by genes from parents.<br><br>In addition,  children's social development includes many contents, such as interpersonal skills, communication skills, and so on. It is definite that teachers will help their students to practice their communication skills via a variety of activities in classes; however, it takes long time for children to master social skills. Children have been  learning these skills since they were born. Their parents are their first teachers.

I personally consider this to be a flawed argument, and I will explain my reasoning in the essay below.<br><br>Important as it is to a child’s overall development, primary education does not provide any necessary work skills. The fundamental aim of this early stage of education is simply to lay a basis for a student’s cognitive development through the learning of language, art and basic science. People who complete this level of education are not equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to enter the workforce. While those people may find blue-collar employment, it is unlikely that they can get a decent job. Therefore, if a country with a high unemployment level only offers primary education to the majority of students, the outcome will not be worthwhile.<br><br>Furthermore, I would argue that investing in secondary schooling systems and delivering secondary education to young students are of greater importance when it comes to improving the overall employment rate of a country. In fact, nowadays, many middle and high schools hire a large number of secondary education degree holders who work better with younger age groups and are more familiar with the subjects taught at this level of education. There are also many other types of non-academic careers, such as in the beauty and entertainment industries, that only require a secondary education degree. Last but not least, I believe that we should not restrict secondary education to a certain group of students who are deemed eligible because everyone deserves an equal opportunity to access education.<br><br>In conclusion, I disagree that providing only primary education is the best course of action to be adopted in the context of a nation with a high rate of unemployment. Secondary education, on the other hand, is a major contributor to combating unemployment. I also believe that we should not dispense secondary education to only a select number of students as everyone has the right to be educated.",
    "Nowadays, the unemployment rate has become more debatable. While some recommended that the government needs to provide support to only primary schools and do not need to secondary schools, I disagree with the statement. In this essay, I will explain why people think in this way and why I disagree with them.<br><br>Those who think that the authority needs to focus on only primary education have their justifications. Firstly, when the authority does not support secondary schools, students will find it more difficult to continue their higher studies. This has led them to move out of the country, resulting in the remaining ones having employments. If people started to move out from countries, for example, as result, it will decrease the need for jobs. Hence, the more people settle in another nation, the more the unemployment rate will decrease.<br><br>On the other hand, it will beneficial for the nation, when government provides a higher level of education. It will help many poor people in their education and lifestyles, which result in the decline of poverty and hunger. This may lead to many new developments as a result of industrialization. For instance, if more people learn, they try to invent new things, the crime rate will reduce. Therefore, the more people educated, the fewer people remained poorer ones.<br><br>In conclusion, although it will reduce the number of unemployed people, it is beneficial for reducing poverty. In my words, despite having a decline in poverty and hunger, it will increase the number of higher educated graduate"

    "contents": [ "Many individuals hold a firm belief that the most essential thing of becoming rich offers numerous chances to help others. I partly agree with this viewpoint and in this essay I will give more examples to clarify my opinion.<br><br>On the one hand, there are reasons why some people argue that it is of utmost importance for affluent people to provide assistance to society. First and foremost, a huge number of wealthy people often grasp an opportunity to donate their money to underprivileged ones and the community. This is because some may think that his contribution is a must and it also helps to promote socio-economic development of his country. Take Bill Gates as a prime example, he is synonymous with the founder of Microsoft, a technology corporations worth billion dollars. As a philanthropist, he not only spent a great deal of his money on charitable activities but also gave donations to help many children who cannot access to academic studies in remote areas. Another example is a Vietnamese group called Vin Group, who improved the air quality of many streets in Vietnam by providing a range of electric buses as they want the people in Vietnam to have a better living quality.<br><br>On the other hand, it can be seen that wealthier people also play another pivotal role. To be more specific, the hope of being rich raises more awareness among young graduates, who want to seek for their well-paid jobs and to have a better living condition after graduation. For example, Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a family of Internet-based business, is a good role model for the deprived people who always harbor their dreams of eradicating poverty and have more convenient lives because he used to undergo unfavorable start-up business; however, he managed to figure out the way to overcome his difficulties just by his own attempts and determination . Needless to say, people like Jack Ma will give much inspirations and influences on people who are making efforts to reach their goals<br><br>In conclusion, while I agree that the purpose of being rich may bring people many chances to help others, I also think that this is not the most important thing because the wealthier can act as a good role model.",
    "The question of whether being rich is primarily about having the opportunity to help others is a subject of much debate. While some argue that wealth offers a unique platform for philanthropy and making a positive impact on society, others contend that personal enrichment often takes precedence over altruism. In my view, both perspectives hold elements of truth, and the relationship between wealth and helping others is more complex than it may initially appear.<br><br>On one hand, it is undeniable that wealth can empower individuals to make substantial contributions to charitable causes and aid those in need. Billionaires like Bill and Melinda Gates, through their philanthropic foundation, have made immense strides in areas such as global health and education. Their wealth has enabled them to tackle some of the world's most pressing problems. Similarly, countless wealthy individuals and corporations donate to charities, sponsor initiatives, and fund research that can transform lives and communities. In this sense, being rich can indeed be a means to help others on a grand scale.<br><br>However, it would be overly simplistic to assume that all wealthy individuals are inherently inclined to help others. The pursuit of riches often leads to a focus on personal wealth accumulation, sometimes at the expense of ethical considerations. The allure of luxury, power, and financial gain can overshadow philanthropic intentions. Moreover, some argue that the very systems that allow individuals to accumulate vast wealth are built on inequality and exploitation, raising ethical questions about the source of that wealth.<br><br>In conclusion, the relationship between being rich and helping others is nuanced. While wealth can provide an unparalleled opportunity to make a positive impact on society, it also has the potential to foster self-interest and inequality. It ultimately depends on the values, priorities, and moral compass of the individual or entity in question. It is essential for society to encourage and celebrate philanthropy while addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate wealth disparities to ensure that those who are rich have the means and motivation to use their wealth for the greater good."

    "contents": [ "The excessive population in the world creates lots of issues rather than other problems such as pollution, energy shortage, et Cetra. I, holistically, agree with this viewpoint, because people need their necessaries, and it is impossible to fulfil the necessities of overpopulation.<br><br>To begin with, the globe has limited resources, which will be used up if people, carelessly, use those resources. However, what if people start using these materials carefully, nonetheless, all these valuable objects will be ended in the long run due to uncontrolled population. This is because all citizens have the right to utilize the energy, which comes from the earth, where governments cannot levy heavy, or pass rigid laws regarding the usage of the power for the excessive inhabitants. For instance, if authorities announced that children, who born in the 21st century, will not use gases. This might not be the solution to saving resources at all. The bureaucrats may pass rigorous laws such as China, which restricts parents by having a one-child policy.<br><br>On the other hand, the earth has been polluted recently neither for the carelessness of the people, nor the unawareness of governments who may not provide slogan to the outskirt of cities for the excessive population. If a country has a huge citizen, no technology would solve the problem of dirtiness. For example, studies have shown that a person exhales 20 tonnes of carbon-di-oxide, which is less compared to the use of a car. For that reason, it is estimated that people are, invariably, responsible for  pernicious particles in  the air, which is getting hotter that causes greenhouse gases and leads to global warming. Thus, if the birth rate is not controlled, pollution will increase rather than decrease.<br><br>In conclusion, overpopulation helps, significantly, to forge the world's problem. I, diametrically, agree that if people cannot control the birth rate, the world will be contaminated more than the past, besides the energy will be finished as<br><br>",
    "Many people consider overpopulation as the main cause of most problems in the world. From my point of view, while many of the world’s issues are caused by overpopulation, I believe that most problems that people are facing already existed before the world’s population explosion.<br><br>It is a proven fact that many problems exist due to overpopulation. Firstly, overpopulation puts a strain on the planet’s natural resources. As people need fuel for their cars, an increasing number of people has increased the demand for fossil fuels, such as oil and gas. These resources are unrenewable, and therefore overpopulation will inevitably lead to the depletion of such resources quicker, potentially causing an energy crisis. Secondly, a dense population means a decline in the quality of people’s lives. Life in big cities, such as Beijing, is a good example of this as there is not enough space to accommodate everyone, with lower-class families having to live in very cramped housing.<br><br>On the other hand, many issues are inherent in human society, regardless of population size. War, for example, has existed since humans lived in tribes with only a small number of people. Nevertheless, war brings strife and destruction to societies. In addition, discrimination based on race, gender and social standing has plagued millions of individuals, even though these issues are unrelated to the size of the population. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that over-population is the main culprit behind most of mankind’s problems.<br><br>In conclusion, overpopulation can cause many problems to society and individuals, however, there are other factors involved as<br><br>"

In other words, the acts of bringing up a product have been significantly developed in comparison to how they were in the past, especially the ones which target teenagers and children. However, it is thought that advertisements whose aim is at young adults should be eradicated. From my perspective, I totally agree with the given statement due to the negative influences on the children's mental and physical health as well as the finances of their family which can be caused by the mentioned type of adversiting.<br><br>To begin with, there is a number of opinions suggest the contrary. In detail, some people contradict that by doing so may result in a degradation of a product because of the lack of young customers. Therefore, the economy of one's nation will on the verge of declining. For instance, chocolate and fast food industries depend greatly on teengers and children. Had it not been for the sophisticated strategy of marketing that aimed at young kids, these industries would not become such successful as they are at the momment.<br><br>On the other hand, prevent children-specified advertisings could incredibly benefit many families that have a low-budget income and the children themselves. Marketing is known for its complexity, therefore, it has a tendency of manipulating young adults to buy or make them ask for more money from their parents to be able to afford those goods. Fast food for example, which is not only cause health problem such as obesity, cancer, etc, but they also consume a huge amount of money because of how adversitings stimulate one being's emotion of their new desserts or new combos, which eventually cost you even more money.<br><br>In summary, the acts of bringing up new release goods can be benefical in some aspects. However, in the long run, the negative effects are observable: financial budget and physical health.",
    "In today's consumer-driven world, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping the choices and preferences of individuals, and it has increasingly targeted children as a demographic. The issue of whether advertising aimed at children should be banned has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that such advertising should be prohibited due to its potentially harmful effects, I hold the view that a complete ban is not the most suitable solution.<br><br>Those in favor of banning advertising targeted at children primarily argue that it can have detrimental consequences on young minds. Children are impressionable and easily influenced, and advertising can manipulate them into desiring products that may not be suitable for their age or needs. This can lead to excessive consumption, unhealthy habits, and even strained relationships within families as children pester their parents for advertised items.<br><br>Moreover, some advertisements may employ unethical tactics to attract children, such as using deceptive messaging or exploiting their emotions. This raises ethical concerns about the impact of advertising on children's mental and emotional well-being.<br><br>However, it is essential to consider that advertising serves a vital role in the economy and can also have positive effects. It fosters healthy competition among businesses, drives innovation, and creates job opportunities. Moreover, not all advertisements aimed at children are harmful. Educational ads, for instance, can promote learning and cognitive development.<br><br>Rather than an outright ban, I believe that stricter regulations and guidelines should be imposed on advertising aimed at children. Governments and regulatory bodies should ensure that such advertisements are both informative and age-appropriate. This can be achieved through rigorous screening processes and penalties for those who violate the rules. Furthermore, parental involvement and media literacy programs can empower children and parents to make informed choices and resist excessive commercial influences.<br><br>In conclusion, while the concerns about advertising targeting children are valid, a complete ban may not be the most effective solution. Stricter regulations, combined with educational initiatives, can strike a balance between protecting children's well-being and maintaining a healthy advertising industry."

    "title": "Countries should try to produce all the food for the population and import as little food as possible. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "contents": [ "The question of whether or not states should be self-sufficient in food production has long been the centre of intense debate, with some believing that countries should produce all foodstuff themselves. Personally, I do not believe states could and should be self-sufficient, since although this can have some positive economic effect e.g. a positive trade balance, it can also bring with it the instability of famines.<br><br>Firstly, a country producing its own food has the benefit of reducing the amount it spends on imports, which has a positive effect economically in the long term. This is a huge consideration in nation-states that are still importing more than they are exporting, for money is technically flowing out of the country. This is why countries such as the USA, despite being the most powerful country in the world economically, still rely on a strong agricultural industry in order to keep their trade balance.  <br><br>On the other hand, food self-production can often lead to famines, for weather conditions can make or break a harvest. In the past, when countries grew their own crops and international trade was far lower, famines were much more frequent as there was more risk involved: a season of bad weather would mean a famine that could last year-round. Importing food from a variety of countries would minimize the risk incurred by fluctuating weather patterns, since risks to crops are more geographically spread out.   <br><br>Overall, I argue that though there are economic benefits to having a country making its own food, the nature of the modern globalized economy means that in the long run, countries might find it much more beneficial to import their food from overseas<br><br>",
    "There are some who believe that countries should be self-sufficient in terms of their food production. This essay disagrees with such a suggestion, due to the potential benefits that food trade brings to all parties involved. These benefits, including effective allocation of resources, improved political atmosphere, and cultural appreciation, will be analysed below. <br><br>Food trade maximizes the effective allocation of resources, as it encourages specialization of production. Due to different resource endowments, each country is effective at producing different food items. If they can import, nations can focus on producing their most efficient good, then trade excess items with other countries. Otherwise, nations would need to reallocate resources to produce what they are not efficient at, driving up the costs of production and causing their citizens to suffer from inflated food prices. An example of this situation is the Common Agricultural Policy used by the European Union, which subsidizes European farmers’ food production. If they EU had imported food from more efficient foreign farmers, the subsidy money could be used elsewhere or saved, while food prices are still manageable. <br><br>In addition, foreign trade creates interdependence between parties involved. As national leaders must take into consideration the impact of political decisions on food trade and commerce, they are less likely to turn to hostile acts that might provoke animosity and lead to war. Thus, this improves the global political atmosphere. Moreover, speaking from consumers’ perspective, food trade brings about more diversity and appreciation for other cultures in terms of their cuisine. An example of this is the popularity of sushi and other Japanese rolls in Western countries, giving rise to the Californian roll – a unique food combination that symbolizes the unique, global world we live in today.<br><br>To reiterate, countries should not attempt to produce all food for their entire population, as trade plays an important role in promoting effective resources allocation, global peace, and cultural appreci<br><br>"
