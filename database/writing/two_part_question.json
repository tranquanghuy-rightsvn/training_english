While there are several reasons for this case, I believed that this trend is a negative development.<br><br>On the one hand, I would argue that this trend is contributed by a number of reasons. First and foremost, academic qualifications are often reliable proof of one's ability. As a result, employers often choose a labour force based on their academic knowledge, which could help them save a great amount of time, while personal qualities can be only demonstrated if the candidate attends an interview or works as a trainee. Another reason is some jobs such as researchers and professors require a high level of academic knowledge which is often reflected by qualifications.<br><br>On the other hand, I claimed that this is a negative development. Firstly, the qualifications given by some universities are unreliable. Gia Dinh University in Viet Nam, for instance, always advert their qualification is quite believed by many corporations, while some researches show students of this college are underestimated most by companies. Another disadvantage is some recruiters may overlook applications of potential personnel who may not have decent certificates. If they could employ those, their companies would witness considerable growth over a period of time.<br><br>In conclusion, even though there are some causes for this phenomenon, it seems to me that the drawbacks are more substantial and the manager of human resources department has to consider when they employ new pers<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "People, with the quality of competitiveness, is highly regarded as a good sign in characters in many communities. This feature influences individuals in several ways, which has both a positive and negative effect on people's life. From my perspective, it is a more positive trend than a negative one.<br><br>To begin with, competitive individuals are conceited and absorbed. As a result, the people around them, such as at workplaces and other romantic can come into conflict for any matter, as they do not tend to show any compromising attitude towards them. Furthermore, being too much competition means creating an uncomfortable situation in job places, since a competitive person always tries to show their haughtiness in any types of works at offices instead of cordial nature towards colleagues. Therefore, for example, in most companies, workers look for friendly co-workers, convenient, reliable workplaces.<br><br>In contrast, people who like competition in life, possess a positive trait. Since they want to go ahead in life among competitors, it, invariably, boosts the economic growth of the company in the long run. For instance, it is noticeable in multi-national companies that if a brand of an organization is blooming and demanded by consumers, it is the competitive nature of employees in other companies where a sense of invincible thirst for achieving that popularity works that leads to achieve their targets. What is more, individuals with competitiveness are resilient and unlikely to go back when faced with any setbacks.<br><br>In conclusion, in communities, there are myriads of people who are competitive, which considers as a positive aspect of life. This quality may sabotage the relationships with family and colleagues at times, while it shows perseverance to gain the goal. In my opinion, the trend of being competitive has eclipsed its  negative t<br><br>",
    "Competitions are a ubiquitous phenomenon, it occurs whether when we are fully grown adults or a child. The feeling of competitiveness affects us on a whole-body scale, ranging from mentality, physical developments and even sanity. With such a relevant appearance, the debate on the effects of competitiveness has been ongoing for several decades and many communities regard a competitive environment as positive. Personally, I also agree with the idea as the disadvantages’ causes can be quickly diagnosed and thus, addressed.<br><br>Competitiveness plays as a stress source in one’s life, yet, it is considered one of the largest encumbrance to ever be known. The ultimate goal of a competition is to not lose to others. However, to accomplish such a statement is a much more abstruse and laborious task. One is heavily pressured to both observe others’ progress and seek the finest strategy. Take a marathon race as an example, a person will need to calculate how long a sprinting interval should last before reaching the finishing line that is at least five kilometres ahead while competing with more than a hundred participants. In another word, we will have to force our mind to work much more excessively in order to succeed. In some cases, our physical state is affected and it varies for different fields.For instance, a blue-collar worker can find spinal problems as much sitting is required while an athlete trains more than his common plan. <br><br>If one is unable to find the best key to victory, the feeling of frustration, irritation and depression arise as a result and those affect the metabolism. It can be deduced this is caused by either too much emphasis is given to a sole competition or paying attention to numerous ones at a time. The most obvious solution is to calm oneself and remain sane. In fact, competitiveness allows the feeling of innovation and motivation. One will need to learn and work much harder to either remain in his position or surpass others. Meanwhile, uncountable knowledge and experiences are gained along the way. Those are undoubtedly beneficial no matter the fields. The most likely example is Japan. This country has been encouraged to develop its technology to the peak as the governments undoubtedly comprehend that being the most advanced country in the world rewards them with even more opportunities such as investment in developing nations.<br><br>In general, competitiveness will only come at a healthy rate unless a person pushes himself more than necessary.

In my view, I fundamentally concur with the following viewpoint that there should the government’s measures to re- orient the country’s population by fostering people having accommodation at regional area.<br><br>As far as I mentioned, the over uniting state at main cities, which contains a range of opportunity from occupation, relationship to being served with top service, is the primary reason which takes responsibilities of multiple problems occurring at the crowded sites, for example, thief, robbery, traffic jams or contaminated habitats,…, contributing to forming negative living environments. The overcrowded state is too dangerous since it provides some detrimental parts of people with chances to do harm towards to the local community, leading to several following disastrous problems then. Therefore, it is the crucial government’s mission that imperatively encourages city dwellers to change their current home-location with good adaptation and integration at new the accommodation. <br><br>Inevitably, places with less exploitation could maintain their own tremendous potential and away- urban towns are those when owning the vast horizon which is available for serving such a number of human’s demands. Moreover, the re- directing with no spontaneous plan seems to be immensely helpful when the transference towards a home- position of  habitants can significantly decline the pressure upon the living capacity of  Megalopolitan. It also creates such a good platform for these places several opportunities to raise the life quality up compared to city life.<br><br>To conclude, had it not been for the deliberate concentration of city population without careful orientation during the last period, there would have been manifold current issues.

    "People living in massive cities often encounter many problems in daily basis. Out of all problems, to my opinion, the main problem is their ignorant behaviour. In other words, people tend to live individually and most of them ignore their surroundings, such as environment, society, etc. <br><br>To illustrate, nowadays, technology has grown rapidly over time and has been used by many people, either for work or study. One of the most popular things about it is social media, for instance Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and many more. Not only it is all over the world, but also society. Some of the recent news is about a girl, who was being harassed by 12 high school students, was hospitalized because of some injuries at her vital area. This news exploded in a nick of time when it was published. Many people, including local artists and celebrities, started to apathy and visit her. At first, it was like the world against  these 12 students, until someone shared the other side of the story and it was proven by police officers and medics. From this, we can learn that hoax message can be very dangerous and it could risk someone else's lives just because of a small problem in our society.<br><br>Even though at some points, it would be better for the government to encourage people to move, but from my experiences, moving to different places does not help changing the world into a better place; it might change a little, but not adequately.  In other words, people tend to argue and do the same thing over and over again. <br><br>To conclude, people have their own problems; it could be big or small.

This essay will present the underlying causes of the mentioned phenomenon and highlights its effects on people's lives.<br><br>There are several factors leading to the decline of family members eating together. Firstly, people are getting busier. Nowadays, the amount of work has increased significantly, many workers want to get more money so they always try to work as much as possible, which leads to a lack of family meals. Another reason is that fast food is getting more popular. Many teenagers who have sedentary lifestyles would prefer delicious fast food rather than home-cooked meals. Fast food has an affordable price, furthermore, it is everywhere. This is the reason why people decide to eat out.<br><br>Lack of family meals can have adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health. First, it would have a bad effect on family bonding. Each family member is not so close, and they will be listless to each other, making it easier to have bad relationships and leading to unethical results. Second, by eating out too much, people can have some chronic illnesses. For example, as body fat percentage increases, the person’s metabolism worsens, resulting in diabetes or heart disease.<br><br>In conclusion, the disappearance of family meals can lead to many bad effects. If not addressed immediately, this phenomenon will have an overreaching effect on many people.",
    "It is true that the traditional family mealtime is becoming a thing of the past. Several reasons could explain why this pattern of behaviour is changing and it can have some adverse impacts on family life and health.   <br><br>On the one hand, there are two main causes responsible for why families no longer share mealtimes as they used to do in the past. Firstly, children are often too impatient to eat at the table, and parents sometimes allow them to have their meal in front of the TV or sitting in front of the computer. Secondly, the close-knit family is disappearing in the face of economic pressures. In single-parent households or families with working mothers, it can be almost impossible to arrange regular times for meals when all the family is together.<br><br>On the other hand, it is undeniable that the disappearance of family meals can have several detrimental effects on the family. From the perspective of the family, meals taken together are an important feature of stable family background. Moreover, when they cannot spend time eating together, the family bonds are likely to be loosened and as a result, the child feeling a lack of affection for their own parents. Besides, it is an essential factor in shaping children’s personality during their formative years. In fact, children who do not have meals with their parents frequently are less likely to develop proper manners. <br><br>In conclusion, based on the aforementioned explanation, disappearing shared family mealtimes can have some negative impacts on children's development."

In my point of view, there are several reasons that lead to this situation, which are shown below.<br><br>Nowadays, when entertainment is developed rapidly in many countries, people, especially young people, are likely to know about pop singers, movie stars. They appear as usual in many social media such as Facebook or Instagram in which the youth is easy to access and read. Furthermore, the youth tend to find attractive things on the internet such as catchy songs, comedy films, which help them relax and unwind stress. As a result, they will find information about the singers who sang those songs or the actors who took take in those movies. Consequently, they know more about international pop and movie stars in the natural way.<br><br>Besides, there are common ways that people should do to enhance their knowledge about the famous people from the past in their own country. Film production firms should produce some historical film to introduce some historical people to the residents, especially the teenage. In addition, instead of learning about the historical people, there are some Boardgames developed by start-up companies trying to put some historical events and characters, which make players know about the historical people in the sufficient way. <br><br>To sum up, in the contemporary world, the young people have a tendency to know more about the international stars due to the effect of social media.

In the essay, I will mention a few causes for this phenomenon and will suggest ways by which the government can reinstate interest in our own music and stars.<br><br>A prominent reason because of which people in my country find an instant connection with international pop and movie stars is of the fast-paced life we live in. Pop songs look to be more real to them. For example, many persons like to drive fast and with pop-songs high beats, they are able to satisfy their adrenaline rush. If in case, they would listen to Indian classical music, they will find it quite slow and boring, so they will ignore it. Additionally, the Indian music classics are more complex and take years of practice to master it, in comparison pop-music is easy to understand using words from daily life. Similarly, the Indian movies and their movie stars do not stand in front of their western counterparts. Most of the movies made here are a copy of some good old Hollywood cinema, and people are smart enough to choose the original one, and hence they start following them.<br><br>In my view, to promote our cultural-music and cinema superstars, the government can start some awareness programs. This will make the current generation aware of the great work our historical figures have done. In addition, the government can make it mandatory in schools, to teach about music legends such as Tansen or Pandit Jasraj. This way, youngsters will get a chance to know them and connect to their roots. In order to make Indian cinema and its actors more popular, the government can grant some additional funds or tax breaks so that with this extra money better sci-fi or historical movies are made, which pleases domestic audience and people start loving their own performers.<br><br>In conclusion, although our young lads find it easy to connect with international pop and movie-stars, their attention can be diverted to the domestic ones. In my view, it is the government's responsibility to tackle these issues, and they can begin by starting some awareness programs or making it mandatory in schools to teach about historical figures from this industry."

I believe that the best alternatives for managing this goal are by reducing poverty and raising the quality of education.<br><br>The main reason I believe that educating people is a priority objective is due to the fact that it would pave the way to develop most of the nations. Firstly, when it comes to education, it is known that the basic grades are important and most parts of the population do not have access to it. Therefore, with most people reaching a higher level of education,  which includes poorer especially in developing countries, the world could figure out on how to coordinate all nations together in order to reduce other issues such as starvation, health and suchlike. Secondly, it would also help develop countries  regarding the economy or technology. <br><br>Furthermore, I support the notion that reducing poverty is important since people would be able to live longer. It is known that the mortality rates have been increasing in the last decades, which is creating a considerable distance between nations; thus, this became a hurdle in regarding the world development since if a country has a high level of mortality  then it will never become a referenced place to live. To illustrate, some countries that are definitely riches in natural resources, such as India, Brazil to name but a few, pursue a high level of mortality which prevent them to grow despite their strong economic situation. <br><br>In conclusion, I believe that reducing poverty and increasing the quality of  education around the world are the best options as regards to rising life quality.

Firstly, it would be an equitable society where has no room for gender inequality, discrimination or the gap between the poor and the rich. It means that all people should have the same chances to access to basic needs such as education and health care systems. Secondly, a dreaming nation must have the sustainable development. In this nation, the government should not only reduce the unemployment rate as much as possible, but also maintain the reasonable cost of living. Beside developing the national economy, protecting and preserving the environment must be taken into consideration in all nations. <br><br>However, it is too difficult for human meeting these requirements when creating this kind of society. This mainly stems from the people’s selfishness and lack of education. Although most of times people fail in achieving a perfect community, there have several practical measures which can be applied as to make our world better place. As for governments and organizations, they might probably launch campaigns which aim to raise the public awareness of living in harmony with other residents and the nature as well. For example, a famous coffee corporation called Trung Nguyen have been providing a number of books to Vietnamese people, which really make a sense of national pride among the society then encourage them to spread their kindness. Furthermore, each individual must treat to others and the natural world as the way they want to be treated. Additionally, the more law-abiding persons, the better a society will become in the not too distant future. <br><br>In conclusion, creating an ideal world is a demanding and challenging mission to all nations.

    "Even though as a part of nature, each human being has a great responsibility to understand and protect the environment in which the humankind are living, the important role of natural world in our daily life has been neglected by people around the globe in the last few decades. This dereliction of duty has had several impacts not only on the fate of the biodiversity of the planet, but also on the living conditions of every human on earth. In this essay, I will discuss the main reasons that cause humans’ ignorance towards environmental matters and offer some measures to tackle this problem.<br><br>The root of today’s ignorant attitude towards the natural world lies within the modern society itself. Among many possible reasons that give rise to the environmental unawareness, the lack of ecological education in academic systems is considered to be the main culprit. While biology is one of the main subjects in schools which teaches about the nature, its teaching contents rarely dig deeper into specific topics like ecology, zoology, botany or environmental protection at the level beyond the basic. Recent research has shown that 40% of students around the world have never heard of or been taught in schools about our current ecosystems’ issues such as climate change or endangered species. Another development of human society that cause the lack of awareness about the nature is the technological advancement. New technologies with great potential to replace the nature’s function on the planet such as artificial trees or robotic animals have caused people to believe that humans are not part of the natural world and therefore do not need to care for the Mother Earth herself. <br><br>In order to deal with the aforementioned matters, our education system should include nature awareness in school curriculum as the main subject with detailed knowledge about the natural world and organize more wildlife picnics to teach students to be environmentally responsible. Furthermore, the government should promote the importance of the natural world by stepping up their environmental awareness programs in the influential social domains such as the entertainment industry. For example, the movie industry should encourage filmmakers to deliver a powerful message about the environment on screen more frequently to inspire people to seek knowledge about this kind of topic. Once the modern citizens are motivated to improve their understanding of the natural world, the environmental unawareness will be decreased.<br><br>In conclusion, it must be said the lack of understanding around environmental matters are a contentious issue with no easy solutions. However, in my mind, it is vital to include all environmental topics as important parts of school curriculums to cultivate nature awareness for people from a young age. It is not unrealistic to expect that concentrating on the environmental education of young students will help raise awareness of the natural world in the future<br><br>"

For one, they play an essential part in society. The rich wisdom and knowledge they have accumulated throughout their lives make them suitable for taking important decisions, resolving conflicts and many other life circumstances. Were it not for them, many families would probably face serious financial mismanagement or divorce due to disagreements and conflicts. We should also not overlook their role in child upbringing. In many countries, they are in charge of raising their grandchildren, so it is an excellent assistance for families where both parents work. I for example spent a large part of my childhood with my grandparents, since my parents were at work, and my grandfather taught me such valuable life lessons as codes of conduct, the importance of respect and the value of education.  <br><br>Nevertheless, a larger number of the elderly than younger individuals can be a cause for concern. This means a reduction in the amount of taxes, for there will be fewer working adults. In effect, the economic development of a country might be impeded markedly, because taxes make up the majority of the government budget. This trend will also likely  engender a burden on healthcare systems. This is because the more people age, the more vulnerable they tend to be to various illnesses. The past COVID-19 pandemic illustrated  how difficult it was to cope with geriatrics in such countries as Spain and Italy, where there is a large proportion of older citizens. <br><br>In conclusion, while having more elderly people than younger individuals can be advantageous for social and family reasons, it might, at the same time, bring about economic and medical challenges. Therefore, I am of the opinion that this change is both beneficial and detrim<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "Utility goods such as apparels and vehicles of well-known brands are increasingly favoured by consumers. It is mostly down to the desire for higher product quality and the reliability of the brand names, and in my view, this is a positive trend for several reasons.<br><br>To begin with, popular labels attract a great number of customers primarily because of the extensive properties of their products. To illustrate, clothes from the top brands are much more durable, and well-known car labels often offer superior safety assurance compared to that of middle-range products. Moreover, brand reputation often goes together with thorough customer review, therefore buyers can avert retail frauds, namely fraudulent advertising or over-exaggeration of product quality, which happen within purchases from smaller and unrecognised brand names. As a result, more customers are enticed to the use of famous-branded merchandises in today's time.<br><br>In general, the practice is proved to be a favourable movement for the community. To further explain, the shift towards a premium range of goods would force manufacturers to invest in their production to keep up with the quality-driven demand, thus discourage possible violation of business ethics. Additionally, the trend is an impulse towards a greener age of consumerism, because it would rule out some environmentally hazardous businesses from the market, the fast-fashion industry as an example. The only worth-mentioning negative impact would be the rise to the monopoly of some dominant brands, which is controllable by the government and trade policies.<br><br>In conclusion, the two most prominent reasons as to why people purchase products from famous companies are trustworthiness and the need for higher-class product qualities. The development is positive to society at large, despite the only drawback being the chance it may turn a company into a monopolistic one.",
    "The number of individuals demanding to acquire goods such as cars, clothes and other items made by famous well-known brands has increased.In my opinion, there is negative growth when an individual buys these goods. However, whether this provides a positive development or not is the topic the essay will delve into. <br><br>On one hand, owning these kinds of products can boost a person's status in society and also make the public respect him or her. For instance, a study conducted by the Washington Post in 2018 has claimed that people inclined to respect others based on the type of cars they owned, watches they wore, etc. The following has been true because owning things others are not able to normally afford shows how wealthy an individual is. Therefore, owning these goods can boost a person's status providing a positive development for them. <br><br>On the other hand, these products can prove to be quite costly and can significantly consume the buyer's allowance or salary. For example, Louis Vuitton, a designer apparel company has turned in significant profits even though it has sold fewer units in the year 2018 mainly due to the fact that its products are very expensive. One should own these kinds of merchandise only if they have surplus cash or are very wealthy. In summary, acquiring these merchandise can prove to be very expensive and is not meant for all providing, hence it is a negative advancement.<br><br>In a nutshell, it appears to me that there is a stronger argument towards products made by famous brands having a negative development.Nonetheless, if an individual can certainly afford the product and can see how it could benefit them in the long run they should definitely buy it as it may prove to have  positive pro<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "Today, people will consume more fountain drinks and sugary beverages than ever before, which has increased obesity and related health problems among the population of the nations around the world. This essay will discuss the major causes of the trend and suggest possible solutions.<br><br>The two main reasons for the growing consumption of sugar-based drinks are excessive advertisements targeting the specific age group and presence of addictive substances in them. Firstly, these beverages are marketed through highly graphic and thrilling adverts, starring the famous celebrities or athletes, that have a fan following in the millions. When, these followers view their ideal drinking these carbonated drinks, they do so too. For instance, the CoCa-Cola is promoted by a famous Indian cricketer Virat Kohli as his secret to energy, which has led to increase in its sale by 5% in the last few years. Secondly, some of these sodas, use ingredients, which are compelling and mood enhancing. Hence, after having it several times a month, an individual is most likely to form a habit of having it regularly. To cite an example, Pepsi consists of caffeine, which is an addictive substance.<br><br>There are numerous steps that can be taken to counter the issue.  To begin with, the authorities can launch campaigns to raise awareness among the citizens about the health problems and diseases caused by over consumption of sodas. Additionally, commercials on telly and radio, should be broadcasted as a part of the campaign. To illustrate it, many ads for the importance of a balanced diet are now telecasted by the specific states, in the many parts of the globe. Furthermore, the ingredients in these beverages can be regulated by the municipalities, to ensure no addictive items are utilised to manufacture them. <br><br>To conclude, the marketing strategies adopted by the firms and compelling ingredients of the sugary sodas are major causes of their growing sales. Provided that, awareness programmes and regulation of the ingredients can solve the problem, to a great extent.",
    "Even though humans have already researched the negative consequences of sugar-based drinks, people are still drinking them. In this essay, I will examine the two primary causes associated with drinkable liquids containing sweet substances and suggest a viable explanation before coming to a reasoned conclusion. <br><br>Firstly, one of the two main reasons why people are drinking carbohydrate-based drinks is advertisements we see every day and the way it tastes. The population gets informed and persuaded that consuming sugary liquid daily is necessary thanks to the media. For instance, while we are watching TV, it is said that fruit juices consist of vital vitamins supporting the growth of children and the immune system, making people consume them frequently. Furthermore, most people have obsessed with these drinks, as it is similar to a drug. The more you drink, the more you desire. Thus, people have become addicted to juice.<br><br>Secondly, promoting awareness among people, which I believe is an effective solution to settle this issue. Citizens will know the fact that the main recipe of juice is water and sugar, where no essential vitamins get mixed, causing diabetes, stroke, and obesity. Moreover, people even pass away because of sugar-rooted disease, which has become quite a common incidence nowadays. For example, adolescents and kids are obsessed with coca-cola and Pepsi; they usually buy these from shopping. Therefore, by comprehending the components of sugar drinks and ramifications as well, people will stop purchasing juice. <br><br>To conclude, having sugar drinks get followed by many adverse consequences, such as diabetes, obesity, and stroke. However, we can stop these illnesses relating to sweets by notifying the population about the fatal effects of sugary d<br><br>"
