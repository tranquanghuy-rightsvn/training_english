    "title": "Many university students live with their families, while others live away from home because their universities are in different places. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both situations?",
    "contents": [ "It is true that, although some university students are able to live with their families while studying in their home town, others are forced to live away from home to pursue their studies. There are advantages and disadvantages to both these situations.<br><br>If university students can live with their families, there are both benefits and drawbacks. Firstly, one major advantage is that they are able to economize, since they do not have to pay for accommodation. Secondly, they enjoy family support in terms of sharing meals, heating costs, possibly even sharing a room with a brother or sister. However, the home situation may also have its disadvantages. Family routines are often disruptive for students who have to concentrate on their studies in a quiet atmosphere. Without a dedicated space in which to study, for example in the evenings or weekends, it is hard to keep up with a study schedule.<br><br>On the other hand, when students live away from home, they also face challenges. One disadvantage is having to find accommodation. Universities are often located in major urban centres, where rents are high if students have to find a room with even the basic facilities. However, there are benefits of learning to study independently in another city. Students are able to escape the distractions of family life, and thereby establish study routines and form friendships with other students who find themselves in the same situation. These factors may help them in their studies.<br><br>In conclusion, while there will clearly be differences in the personal circumstances of individual university students, some potential advantages and disadvantages of living at home or away from home can be identified.", "University studies are most important to every individual to achieve a job in good company. Most of the students live in their home and go to their universities to study while there are some others who study by staying far away from their place. Both have its own merits and demerits and I will reflect both my sides in the following passage.<br><br>Firstly, getting educated by residing with families is a great opportunity for an individual. Because, one no need to stay away from their parents and also no need to adjust with different persons at the new place. Secondly, if an individual feel depressed and if there is any discomfort they can happily share with their parents. For example, if a student is not feeling well they can serve by their parents by having food and medicines as per timings. <br><br>On the flip side, studying by staying at different place also has some advantages. Primarily, getting educated in a university at different place makes you live independently. At the same time, you can have a chance to mingle with different country's people, which helps you to gain knowledge in different aspects. Therefore, there are also some drawbacks like missing family and home food. Accordingly, if one habituated to stay away from families they can be experienced staying privately which helps them in their future. By staying away from home makes an individual to do their work by themselves. <br><br>After having considered all the points that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that both have their advantages and disadvantages. Further, choosing to study in a university totally depends upon one's mentality."

    "title": "Some cities have few controls on the design and construction of housing and office buildings. People think that they are free to choose the design they like. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "contents": [ "Many have an opinion that people who are constructing houses or buildings, should be able to create them with their own design. I agree with the point of view as it has many advantages likes the freedom to express their own design and cost of a building can be reduced to their budget.<br><br>Firstly, people should have the right to choose a type of construction and design of there house as they are building on their own land. This will help them to design the exterior and interior of there house based on their requirements. For example, if an individual wants to create an out of the world design, then he can be able to do so without any restriction from the city officials. Therefore, the public should have full freedom to design their house as per their needs.<br><br>Secondly, with the advent of technology, many cheap materials can be used by which cost-cutting can be done and that will not be possible if the cities want to adhere with specific policies of use of materials. These technologies and planning of the residence can reduce financial value. For instance, a modular building, affordable housing, movable housing are the current concepts of construction by which capital required can be minimized drastically. Hence, people should be able to choose, what kind of material they want to use while constructing a building.<br><br>In conclusion, the advantages of people selecting the type of design will engulf the selection done by the officials of the city as the public will have a wide range of idea to select from and they can take measures to reduce the<br><br>",
    "In the modern urbanised world, cities are becoming more congested and certain restrictions pertaining to home and building designs are being imposed by town authorities. There are many pros and cons of this phenomenon but I think the advantages clearly outclass the disadvantages.<br><br>To commence with the benefits of such restrictions  the town planners clearly have a vision of sensitive and delicate areas and can impose authority accordingly. Osaka, for example, is a metropolitan city in Japan where modification to the household is prohibited and one has to live in government-built homes as rules are there to safeguard society from mishappening due to the extensive databases available with the government. Moreover, by imposing such restrictions authorities in case of theft,robbery and natural disasters will have knowledge about house design and can easily rescue people.<br><br>On the other hand, restriction on homes contradicts  liberty to live and many organisations in past opposed such jurisdictions. North Korea, for ,instance restricts the population from leaving the country and living freely in the open world as it will curtail the power of the authoritarian regime. ,Moreover many African nations like Sudan,Mali, Burkina Faso, and Libya are examples of such practices. Moreover, similarly designed houses will create boredom and monotony among people and there will be no excitement after the new purchase of flats.<br><br>In conclusion, despite some shortcomings in restrictions imposed during town planning it is worth is as  it can safeguard from any upcoming threat and I also completely agree with that statement."

Despite technology's great convenience, it can hinder people from forming profound and significant connections. <br><br>The rise of the internet and technology has allowed people to conduct various activities online, from shopping to working and communicating with others. This is because technology offers tremendous convenience, as individuals can buy products and services from the comfort of their own homes, work remotely from anywhere in the world, and communicate with people from different parts of the globe. This has dramatically improved the quality of life for many individuals, especially those living in isolated areas with mobility limitations. Additionally, online communication has brought about greater diversity and understanding, as people can connect with others from different cultures and backgrounds. As demonstrated, the ability to carry out various activities online has numerous advantages and has significantly impacted how people live.<br><br>Despite the benefits of online activities, there are also negative consequences associated with the lack of in-person interactions. The impersonal nature of online communication can prevent individuals from building deep, meaningful relationships essential to human connection. Furthermore, when people rely heavily on technology to communicate, they may experience social isolation, especially among younger generations who spend much time on social media. Social isolation has been linked to adverse mental health and well-being effects, such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, balancing online and offline interactions is vital to maintain healthy relationships and social connections in today's digital age.<br><br>In conclusion, while there are advantages to the ability to shop, work and communicate with people online, the lack of face-to-face contact can have negative consequences.

I believe that living without face-to-face communication has brought a significant number of drawbacks, but I would partly agree with this statement.<br><br>On the one hand, residentsâ€™ life will be more convenient and easy due to the dramatically increased of the Internet. To begin with, the people nowadays are able to shopping and working online which will not time-consuming because they can stay at home and do anything without travelling with a long distance. Almost the consumerâ€™s home, and they just need to pay for shipping fee, which is always cheaper and sometime there is some promotion so the productâ€™s price can be discounted. Moreover, the Internet brings user the opportunities to contact with the friends or relatives that they cannot meet in the daily life due to the distance. For example, there are a substantial number of apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp to call for every day from all around the world.<br><br>On the other, although social network and internet have a huge of benefits, there are also some drawbacks of these online sources. Initially, the interactive communication would be reduced because the citizens spend too much time on surfing the Internet to shop and chat. For instance, children in the modern life have tended to play game on the Internet, so they do not have time for outdoor activities like football, go camping, and so on, which helps them to comprehensive development. Besides, lacking the socializing skill, the citizens can cause some health problems like myopia, obesity, and so on.<br><br>To sum up, the benefits it brings do not justify the fact that it is damaged badly on our interactive communication."

During such online conferences, there is no other way but to lose the human touch factor. In most cases, we can discuss agendas overall to eliminate major difficulties, leaving subtle unresolved problems which hinder achieving full satisfaction. Another disadvantage which comes along with this phenomenon is the inability to provide a full picture regarding the issue. The ability to discuss and report about work in online meetings might be limited because of limited time or distance between online meeting participants.<br><br>Working and training processes online, however, according to me, have tremendous benefits. Ability to make our schedules flexible, to begin with, is a significant advantage which we should consider with our heavy schedules.

This might also be fruitful for the environment.<br><br>One commonly cited disadvantage of online business meetings and training is that it could affect the social dynamics of both the entrepreneurs and the workers. This is because in person discussion would be missing, which might create misunderstanding in between them.For instance, during face to face meetings one can describe the issues better as the person is able to use body language and gestures which help to understand the message in a better way.<br><br>Despite this there are a number of significant benefits to having online conferences and trainings.First of all, having an online as to skill training and employment needs would reduce the extra charges spent on expenditures.Because conferences and skill preparations will be happening online so the entrepreneurs would have no need to make extra purchases.For example, to open an educational institute one need to buy a rental space for different cabins which would require a set of PCs, air conditioners, LED bulbs, chairs and so on.Hence, following online work conferences and training can actually help to save a substantial amount of money.<br><br>Another key benefit is that it would help to save time and  contribute to mitigate the  global pollution.  Because commuting to the office will be lessened so it would reduce traffic on roads.A growing body of research to suggest that Japan is a highly prosperous city where people are more efficient and fighting fit. The reason behind  that productivity is their working style which is online system and their healthy environment. <br><br>In conclusion, although the online system has some drawbacks, it is clear that becoming an online earner  and learner can literally be a significant step to move ahead towards an egalitarian<br><br>"

Therefore, some tours which organized to visit some far- sighted places are becoming more popular because people nowadays show a bigger prefers to see new areas. However, there are some upwards and downwards trend to both local people and the environment.<br><br>Admittedly, the growth of the tourism industry has brought enormous benefits to local people. More tourists mean greater demand for food, accommodation and services, all of which create job opportunities and help to alleviate unemployment in the area. For instance, there are some museums for tourists to visit to obtain knowledge about the local history and observe some historical relics that unique to one region. The development of tourism also has ripple effects on local infrastructure, with more roads and bridges being built to meet the need of the tourists. Moreover, with the development of the area, local residents are able to earn a living by selling souvenirs such as handicrafts or postcards to visitors.<br><br>On the other hand, this trend would merely bring detrimental effects to the environment of the area, particularly plants and animal species.

In some places, waste from the hotel industry is becoming an environmental problem that concerns many people, not just environmentalists. Another drawback is that increased tourism may break social cohesion in the local community. Many people make a living by providing services for travellers and become rich while many others remain poor and struggle for the next meal. This wealth gap is gradually widening and has detrimental impacts on the bond and the shared values of indigenous individuals.<br><br>In conclusion, although the growth of tourism to remote areas and exotic countries is beneficial to some extent, it is more likely to have harmful impacts on local people and the environment"

Personally, I think this tendency comes with both positive and negative effects.<br><br>On the one hand, changing lifestyles bring about various positive impacts on family connections. Firstly, people are paying more attention to their well-being nowadays, and therefore family members tend to go to fitness centres together to lead healthier lifestyles. As a result, spending time working out together will help to bridge the generation gap and promote better communication between family members. To illustrate, when a child takes part in some forms of sport or physical activities with their parents, they will feel more open to share things and seek advice from them. Secondly, thanks to developments in technology, devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptop computers have not only become an indispensable part of our lives but have also helped to make communicating with our friends and families much easier, particularly between those who are separated by long distances.<br><br>On the other hand, changes in lifestyles also have their downsides when it comes to family relationships. To begin with, the overuse of such technological devices mentioned above, can also hurt family relationships. For example, if family members become too immersed in using their devices for individual recreational purposes, like checking their social media accounts or browsing their favourite websites, they may neglect their relationships with other family members. Consequently, the amount of quality time that a family spends together is likely to reduce, negatively impacting family relations. Furthermore, these days, people are becoming more and more career-oriented and are subsequently losing the balance between work and family life. In fact, it has become more common that family members are less available at home, even outside of official working time, leading to weakened family interactions<br><br>In conclusion, while some changes in lifestyle are advantageous to family relationships, the opposite is true for other changes.",
    "Nowadays, in large part of the world, human life is experiencing quite considerable changes which are impacting on their familial interaction. Though the busy modern lifestyle, based on technological revolution, has brought an opportunity to maintain a constant online contact, this essay believes that this trend is never compensating the gap of a real connection, rather it is inviting serious drawbacks. I am going to elucidate the idea in more detail.<br><br>To begin with, previously there was a time when people needed to travel to see their families, whereas now, regardless of their distance, family members can stay connected via different online platforms. Without going anywhere, they can establish real time audio-visual contact via different incredible online platforms, such as Facebook, Skype, Zoom etc. Not merely communication, they are also giving instant supports by means of ubiquitous shipment services. For instance, now parents can pay their childâ€™s abroad tuition fees instantly just by a click on their online account, or simply by tapping on their smartphone.<br><br>On the other hand, the modern lifestyle is not free from blame when it comes to a true relationship. Due to the unprecedented ease of connection, people are mostly unintentionally stuck in multitasking, such as they are talking over phone, watching tv, and working on laptop simultaneously. This type of communication is creating an insidious damage in terms of deep and natural familial interaction. This contact style is lack of attentive listening and understanding the speaker, thereby missing a vicarious presence in the conversation. As a result, family members are losing the feeling of attachment and ending up with breaking down, which has a trickledown effect in their overall life. <br><br>To conclude, despite some minor advantages regarding the effect of fast and advanced form of human life on family, I believe that the serious drawbacks like unstable relationship and vulnerable mental condition in between family members obviously have more weight to con<br><br>"

However, there are others who think of it as disadvantageous. I believe that this has more advantages than disadvantages.<br><br>To commence with, the most argued disadvantage is that, it would put an extra burden on the students from the financially weaker sections. For example, if there is an exchange programme between schools from the USA and India, even middle-class parents of the Indian student will find it difficult to arrange a heavy sum of their child's expenses in the USA. Secondly, even if a youngster is knowledgeable, there are chances of him/her experiencing culture shock because of the new environment.

Firstly, it provides a teenager with a lifetime experience. They are introduced to new cultures and thus, their mind broadens. They become more accepting of people with different views, which helps them in life. Furthermore, it can help them in their careers. It has been found that students who went for such programmes are given a preference by the companies because this means they can adjust to difficult circumstances easily. For instance, many multinational companies hire managers with the experience of working abroad, so that they can send them to their offices all over the world.<br><br>To conclude, sending teenagers to some other country for studies does have some disadvantages.

Meanwhile, some teachers opine that studying in other countries could have numerous benefits while others do not believe in the positive impacts of transferring youngers. Here some of the main proponents and opponents of this issue will be discussed.<br><br>From one point of view, adolescence is the best time for gaining experience in different fields. Therefore, moving to other states undoubtedly help youngers broaden their horizon. For instance, students will learn how to manage their life and communicate with foreigners which can lead to increasing their self-esteem. Also, teenagers might get familiar with different learning methods, and using these methods will come along with success in their lifetime.<br><br>From another point of view, undoubtedly, youngers are sensitive, and any changes in their lives could have negative effects. Hence, immigration at young ages may put so much pressure on their shoulders that cannot be taken by minors. Moreover, a sense of isolation is inevitable while starting to live in a new place, and this could affect their social skills. Last but not least, studying subjects in a new school, especially, in a different language may result in the lower performance of students. <br><br>To put it in a nutshell, with respect to the whole views mentioned above, exchanging teenagers have both merits and demerits.

There are both advantages and disadvantages of this trend.<br><br>On the positive side, the increasing use of some languages will have a beneficial effect on communication between people from different countries. For example, English has become the lingua franca in many parts of the world, easing the difficulty in communication among people with different language backgrounds. It is the dominant language in many global aspects from science, diplomacy to international business so that cultural misunderstandings will be eradicated, global trade flourish and international partnerships are established. This is the reason why the ability to speak English or other languages that have global functionality is a necessary skill in the modern world.<br><br>On the negative side, the dominance of some languages while other languages are dying out is associated with the cultural loss. It is a fact that language and culture are interrelated, so losing a language means a culture is on the verge of extinction. In contrast, the dominant languages bring their own culture and endanger others, thereby the loss of cultural diversity on our planet. In addition, languages include historical values. An example for this is that a huge amount of knowledge in books and ancient documents cannot be extracted as they are written in the forgotten languages. Therefore, threatened languages should be saved to preserve the identity of people who are speaking them.<br><br>In conclusion, the increasing use of a few languages and the decline of others is both a positive as well as a negative development.

    "Today, only a few languages reign supreme in most countries, whilst the usage of many other languages have declined. I argue in this essay why I believe this is an unwanted trend, for although it could help stimulate economic growth, the long-term consequences of cultural erosion is comparatively more undesirable.  <br><br>On the one hand, it could be said that as a result of globalization, more people are learning the languages of world-leading economies, which leads to a greater overall increase in global GDP. At the moment, being bilingual boosts employment opportunities drastically for prospective employees since they can bridge the gap between two different cultures and economies. For instance, English and Chinese are the languages of choice today, and fluency is a skill sought after by international employers as they hope to do business in both English and Chinese speaking countries.  <br><br>However, it could be posited that language is the foundation of culture, and if people cannot communicate, they cannot form a collective identity: the result would be that the culture gets eroded over time. Going into more detail, some words in many languages cannot be translated to others precisely because they are specific to a cultural context; the decline of a language would also mean the decline of a culture. Using a more specific example, the Welsh language is barely spoken because the English sought to replace their culture following an invasion; thus, learning Welsh has been considered an important way to preserve culture for many young Welsh people.  <br><br>In conclusion, whilst I argue that although the use of only a few languages over the many can lead to more economic development, it is still nonetheless more important that people preserve their individual cultures; thus the aforementioned trend has been an unwante<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "These days, societies are given different career opportunities. Having different career options makes it more likely people move their accommodation as well for a number of times. This essay will discuss the issue of whether this gives society a positive or negative impact on their life. In my opinion, this is certainly positive as people can have more horizons and be avoided from boredom. <br><br>Firstly, one of the reasons why the public tends to alter their profession and house is that they believe by doing so they will obtain more new horizons. It is argued that the profession and house alteration could offer individuals new insights and knowledge from the population that he or she meets in a new place. For instance, I have a sister who has changed her job frequently and moved to another place to live several times. She says that this allows her to have new skills which are needed to gain a better job in the future. Therefore, it is worth it to somewhat shift the occupation a couple of times. <br><br>Secondly, moving out and in from one place to another in order to have a different career and home is promising to avoid being bored. It is commonly acknowledged that having the same environment and meeting the same people are somehow resulting in being bored. Consequently, the workers cannot work optimal and perform well at work. For example, when I used to be a teacher at a school five years ago. I worked for the school for three years and turned out to work badly as I was feeling bored in the same atmosphere for a quite long time. Thus, changing a new job more than once can give persons the motivation to perform well at work. <br><br>In conclusion, though changing careers several times might sound strange for some people, for others this can be preferable as they are more likely to have new experiences and avoid boredom. In my personal view, this is positive since the societies are given opportunities to gain more new perspectives and escape from being bored.",
    "These days, more and more people tend to change their jobs and living places many times during their lifetimes. Personally, I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages for society in some cases, as it provides people with opportunities for personal and professional development.<br><br>On the one hand, people who alter their work may struggle to maintain long-term connections. They lack regular interaction with their ex-colleagues if they change their workplaces frequently. However, this can be addressed by using technology to connect with each other. Relocation can have difficulty in facing  severe culture shock, which could lead to anxiety and stress. Though this issue can be resolved easily if people pay attention and respect the culture in a new area.<br><br>On the other hand, those who decide to make a career change can expand their professional networks and learn to adapt to a new work environment. For a long time, they can accumulate these experiences and pick up them in a new position. Therefore, they can have more advantages than other candidates in the job market. By changing their places of residence, individuals can approach  different cultures and ways of life, thereby they can extend their cultural awareness. People find it easier to make a new relationship when they know about the traits of others and this contributes to a more accepting society. For example, Korea was a nation which was isolated in the past, but nowadays it become a wealthy country which attracts many people who want to work and live there. <br><br>In conclusion, a growing number of people vary their places of work and living. But these are far shadowed by the benefits offered by such decisions."

    "title": "In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?",
    "contents": [ "It is not uncommon to see people in modernized regions live by themselves in small apartments. While some believe that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its advantageous, however, I personally reckon that this is a positive trend for personal development.<br><br>Firstly, living on one's own promotes an independent living environment as one will have more private spaces. They will find it more convenient and enjoyable to pursue their passions outside their work arrangement and professional lives, without being concerned that their activities may interrupt other members. For example, some individuals often gravitate towards musical instruments such as piano, guitar or violin, and these types of hobbies can be quite loud. As such, living in a nuclear family eliminates the concerns of having to consider other factors such as the opinions of others or bearing responsibilities for them. As a result, they find extra time to think and spend their own, which is incredibly essential for their personal growth.<br><br>In addition, economic security is another major reason for people to choose live by themselves or in small family sizes. Nowadays, individuals play different roles in their personal and professional lives they have perspective responsibilities to carry, and forming a small-sized unit can ease off some financial burdens off their shoulders when someone lives by themselves, or just as a couple, or having only a single child along with them.  For instance, they can easily make extensive calculations of their daily expenses in the house, including electricity bills, water bills or management fees, to how they can manage their financial conditions to provide a quality and decent life for their children. Moreover, saving a considerable amount of money for unexpected future emergencies or events would also be easier for them as they do not have to always fend for other members, which allows them to avoid unmanageable expenses.<br><br>On the other hand, the downside of living alone in small-sized units is reduced human interaction. Having a self-isolated lifestyle means that individuals may have no one to talk to when they get home, and they cannot share their feelings over some happenings during the day or have discussions on difficult circumstances. For example, they forgo the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of a large family and are left to their own devices for extended periods. Instead of having meaningful conversations with their family members, they devote most of their leisure time to binge-watching episodes or surfing the internet relentlessly. Therefore, this may weaken the bonding with loved ones and create a sense of isolation.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that leading an independent life in a nuclear family encourages the development of a person's passion and a better financial arrangement towards a high living standard, even though such a lifestyle may weaken family relationships and promotes self-isol<br><br>",
    "Currently, there is a shrink of family size observed in some countries, as citizens tend to live more independent than people were in the past. Personally, I believe that this tendency has both positive and negative impacts on human life.<br><br>In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, leading to some advantages for the development of individuals as well as families. People could have more freedom to travel and live far away from their home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and gaining valuable experience from this makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. As growing in a small family unit, conflicts between family members would be remarkably limited in comparison with a multi-generational family. As a result, the relationship between all family members is more and more close-knit that would support mentally the development of each members' life.<br><br>However, one-person households are more vulnerable as facing financial and health issues. It is true that life is more complex and difficult, especially because the costs of living has increased so dramatically. Without the help from other people, it would be impossible for many people to pay all living costs such as buying a car, paying a deposit or even purchase food. Moreover, for some people, particularly the elderly, living alone could trigger mental illness such as depression or autism if people segregate themselves from human contact in the long run.<br><br>In conclusion, the shrink of household size is accompanied by both merits and demerits. Therefore, I personally remain uncertain whether this trend is positive or not."

Some people think that people can choose to build houses in their own styles instead of building them with the same as the old house style in local areas. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "contents": [ "There is the freedom to build new homes according to dwellers' favourite outlooks in a few urban areas. It is generally thought by folks that they can select their desired housing styles. Despite this scenario will distort the beauty of cities, I reckon that desirable structures of houses are more advantageous as they provide more comfort levels and the ability to make homes within budgets. <br><br>Those who argue the disadvantages of making houses according to people's choices point to the loss of the integrity of a city. This is due to the fact that if every person will make their residences as per their choices, they will not control some factors such as heights, width and parking areas. Consequently, the beauty of the city will be completely damaged. Moreover, they also tend to worry about their status in society since those who are poor, will feel discriminated against as they can not compete with the structure of an affluent mansion.<br><br>However, I understandably believe that there are some powerful benefits of building residences as per choices. The first and foremost is the comfort level which is given by the selected house design. If the living place is made according to people's preferences ,for example, lightening, the direction of the building and gardens etcetera then they will enjoy more these facilities. Secondly, one can construct buildings within their available budget which is a relief for middle-class families.<br><br>In conclusion, while I acknowledge that constructing living areas according to the preference of individuals have certain drawbacks in terms of diminishing the attractiveness of urban areas and discrimination between the rich and destitute masses, I would argue that because of pleasant and financial benefits, the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages.",
    "It is irrefutable the fact that nowadays constructing a house is more important for living in metropolis areas and people believe they can build their buildings according to their own spirit as the old house in countryside areas. Therefore, the advantages more than disadvantages of this trend and I will clarify my viewpoint by giving examples and justification of my ideas.<br><br>There is no denying the fact that nowadays accommodation is more crucial in the cities for living and building a new house by following old style is better because it helps them to stay there for the long by attaching with that. Moreover, if they will construct houses same as the old ones so they can live old culture and tradition for the only ruin because nowadays more number of younger ones follow new trend and style so if they see these types of earlier activities so they can learn more about their history and tradition and can escalate their adequate knowledge for the coming future.<br><br>Furthermore, if dwellers will construct new houses the same as the design of old residences so it will give them a sense of satisfaction and relief when they visit their homes. On the other ,hand it has some downsides too. For example, it can cause debate in families because nowadays most of the growing ones prefer to live a luxurious lifestyle and they do not want to follow the old trend so if their parents will build the houses same as before so it will brake the relations between families. In addition, old things are not easily available these days owing to enhancement in modern cities and if the material is available so it would be quite expensive that not suitable for the old pattern houses in cities.<br><br>To conclude, I reiterate that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of keeping the old style of apartments for making new homes."

    "contents": [ "In these days, global food demand has aroused peopleâ€™s discussion. However, the consumption of imported food has gained popularity and is considered an alternative to domestic food. My belief is that the positive aspects of this matter overlooked its drawbacks.<br><br>To begin with, this trend certainly exerts some detrimental implications for the environment. First, since the act of transporting food from a country to another, requires frequent use of air planes, which are the most fuel-hungry means of transport in the world. This means that while foreign foods are transported into the world. This means that while foreign foods are transported and refrigerated to keep them fresh during the transporting process, thereby increasing global pollution from exhaust fumes. For example, Boeing 747 burns thousands of gallons per flight, such a huge amount of gasoline burnt highly detrimental to the atmosphere. Clearly, the negative impacts of oversea food have caused environmental damage.<br><br>On the other hand, there some dazing advantages that can easily overshadow the demerits. By increasing the diversity of food, food produced in other regions provides customers with more options with exotic tastes and experiences that local people had not had previously. In fact, people these days from different countries are able to enjoy various kinds of products that are non-existent in their home countries. Moreover, many of the delicacies we like, several of which would appear in our tonightâ€™s tables, are a mixture of ingredients indigenous to different parts of the world. Therefore, it would be a huge loss if we relied solely on local ingredients.<br><br>In conclusion, while there are plus points to the merits of imported food, too much would be lost as a result. One should therfore weigh up the pros and cos and consider their priorities when deliberating whether or not to<br><br>",
    "It is often argued that civilians could consume more amount of food which is grown in other territories. However, others believed that by consuming a huge quantity of cuisines from other regions rather than local supplements. In my perspective, I believe positive aspects of this outcome would overweigh the drawbacks. Let us discuss in detail about positive and negative development of this trend.<br><br>First of all, people can try a wide variety of nutrient foodstuffs from various regions, those are useful for their dietary plans. Mankind is always interested to enhance their body to keep fit and healthier although some food products could be harmful to their health such as fast food and other junk food.<br><br>Therefore, people can choose various food from other nations based on their health factors. For instance, the fruit avocado has the much essential nutrients to consume for the human body. Thus, there are enormous benefits to having a plethora of nutritious supplements.<br><br>On the other hand, the native food-making dwellers might be non-profitable. There are myriad beneficiaries for the individuals consuming food from other territories whereas, local products might lose their business is inevitable. For example, some of the healthier cereals such as mice, wheat, ragi products sales had been completely eradicated. Moreover, this would suffocate the native business holders and their families to be in famine. Hence, civilians need to show interest by buying these food supplies to make them profitable.<br><br>In conclusion, there are some negative impacts of losing local business however, the merits are more by consuming various nutrients. In addition, I personally support the positive impacts."

Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?",
    "contents": [ "As a result of urbanization, urban areas are now surrounded by suburbs, which often feature large out-of-town shopping centres. Inevitably, these retail outlets are becoming attractive alternatives to small town-centre shops, leading to potential widespread car use. In spite of the possible benefits, I think there are more evident disadvantages to consider.<br><br>It is true that large shopping malls especially those chain stores offer a wider choice of products and services with a more competitive price due to economies of scale. As more people go shopping there, the multi-faced development of the outskirts of cities, such as economy and tourism etc., will be promoted. This could mitigate migration to downtowns, thereby reducing urban population density.<br><br>However, there are some highly undesirable effects of this development. For one thing, a growing preference for large department stores in the suburbs could run small-town shop owners out of business. Most large outlets are operated by enterprises that aim to maximize profits without considering any mercy for small shops. For another, it is imaginable that the desire to shop at suburban shopping malls could prompt the public to be more dependent on automobiles, thus resulting in the increasing number of car ownership and environmental pollution. This trend, eventually, could exacerbate congestion and, by extension, the growing demand for fuels and the damage to the environment. While people are struggling with severe problems caused by congestion and pollution in metropolises, we should not make the situation worse.<br><br>To conclude, despite the advantages of establishing shopping malls on the outskirts of urban areas, shopping there does harm small businesses and indeed takes a toll on our society.",

Thus, people are more inclined towards shopping in big cities which has a negative impact on businesses in small towns as well as  increases the cost of purchased goods. I believe, the following practice has more drawbacks in comparison to the benefits associated with the aforementioned trend.<br><br>To begin, people going out of their vicinity to buy a product which is also available in their area is adding an extra financial burden on individuals. Unconsciously, they are spending more on travelling than the original price of goods. For instance, if they buy the same item from a store near their home, they will have to pay far less in terms of total expenditure. Moreover, the travelling time can  be utilized for other recreational activities such as watching movies with a family or playing games to spend quality time with the family. Furthermore, local businesses are badly affected by this shift due to a limited number of customers. <br><br>On the other hand, the bright side of the picture includes the availability of better quality and mental satisfaction. Undoubtedly, large towns have shopping malls with all the varieties present under one roof. Therefore, people feel comfortable buying the best available options. For example, in case of any issue with the product, they have to face the fatigue of driving all the way back in order to exchange or return the item.<br><br>To conclude, by considering the rising cost and extra miles associated with  shopping from large out-of-town stores, it is evident that the advantages like mental satisfaction and personal contentment become insignificant.
