    "title": "Some people think that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment, so it should be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
    "contents": [ "After the industrialisation revolution, there is an increasing concentration on developing economy, as well as the concern of the environment. Some people believe that economic progress is more beneficial that can tackle problems of poverty and hunger, while others say that this kind of advancement is harmful to the ecosystem and must stop now. In the following essay, I will discuss both views with proper examples and draw a reasonable conclusion.<br><br>On one hand, people who suppose to forbid economic growth may argue that there are several drawbacks of such kind of advancement. An obvious example can be viewed by pollution done by factories, vehicles and households. Carbon dioxides emitted by those group boost the growth of temperature due to greenhouse effects, leading to melting of ice glaciers in polar areas. I hold a pessimistic opinion that human may not cope with an even small rise of the sea level well. Coastal cities would be flooded, especially for countries who do not have the means to protect low-lying areas, and people who live there would lose their jobs, homes, and even life. Thus, it seems logical to slow down the economic growth for the purpose of preventing that situation above.<br><br>On the other hand, admittedly, the improvements in the economy bring residents numerous advantages. Firstly, a healthy economy can result in job creation, high level of employment, and higher salaries for citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that governments have more funds to spend on infrastructure. For instance, a government with higher revenue can invest more in construction of public transport system which can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, healthcare system which benefits the whole society and poverty alleviation, which reduces the poverty gap and guarantees people with lower income to living with better conditions. The final merit is that a strong economy helps the country’s standing on the global stage, in terms of its political strength and trading power.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe that economic advancement should be never stopped, because it can help the community to treat its citizens well in terms of living standards, and a country with greater economic potentials is more likely to tackle the environmental problem caused. Thus, the pros of such an improvement outweigh its cons.",
    "In the recent decade, almost every country is desperate to develop the economy as it is believed by some people that is the only way to solve world poverty issue. However, there are still many others who are holding the view that financial growth is causing us more harm than good as it destroys the environment. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my opinion on this matter.<br><br>On the one hand, it is obviously true that poor nations are those countries with a sick economy. For instance, once the financial has big problems, it will inevitably lead to a lack of money in circulation. To be more precise, in such states job opportunities are less, and people cannot earn their livelihood or even emigrate to another place for a better life. Furthermore, another consequence for a poor nation is that the medical condition is usually very bad, so that deceases and pandemics are more than common, which will then result in a worse living situation. Therefore, no wonder citizens in such a country are planning to move out to a better place for them to put better food on the table and to achieve their dreams. This can only happen in a nation with a booming economy. That is why many governments are putting economic growth as their priority. <br><br>On the other hand, we all admit that economies are growing at the expense of the environment. For example, city expansion, new buildings, the fast transportation system are all direct reasons that contribute to the carbon dioxide emission, reaching to a warning height. As natural resources have been fully explored, global warming is now an undisputed issue for everyone to concern.  So, if we continually chasing the benefits of a prosperous economy, the chances are, we may lose our habitat forever. Eventually, there won’t be any form of economic pursue, rather only a bare land and the real poverty for human beings to bear. <br><br>In conclusion, a thriving financial condition is a basis for a better life, but concerning the current rate of consuming the resources of the earth, it will no longer be able to meet up with our demand. As a result, my view is that we need to fight poverty by investing in our economy in a more sustainable way. If this is not done, we will either die of hunger or of our polluted surroun<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "An exponential increment in the number of crimes makes a peaceful life impossible. Some people argue that life imprisonment would reduce the number of illegal activities while the remaining support alternative ways to dwindle crime rates. These topics have been profoundly discussed in various international forums .I will discuss my point of view before coming to a conclusion.<br><br>Even though , a longer prison sentence is a hard punishment it has failed to decrease various criminal activities in  society. This type of fearless punishment makes culprits  attempt more illegal actions. Because they know that the government would make healthcare support and good living conditions during imprisonment. Additionally, Human Rights Commission may come forward to offer  support for the accused person. For instance,in ,India a rape case had been reported several years ago. However,  the culprit who committed this crime got a commute in punishment when the court found that he is a disabled man. These shreds of evidence show that the number of crimes may not be mitigated only by sentencing long-term imprisonment.<br><br>On the other hand, punishments such as public beheading,stoning,amputation and lashing are alternative ways that found as effective in reducing serious criminal offences in many countries. Strict implementation of these kinds of actions could make a person think twice prior to taking a wrong decision. To illustrate, Saudi Arabia is is known for less number of crimes especially against women as it enforces strong and strict criminal law punishments.Therefore, government authorities in each and every country need to discuss the benefits of alternative punishments and try to implement them as early as possible.<br><br>To conclude, it is acceptable  to find different ways while punish the culprit rather than relying on a single one like imprisonment. Because it can ensure a crime-free and peaceful life in society",
    "In the modern era, the crime rate is unstoppable and incalculable regardless of place and time. Therefore, a fair number of experts believe that the longer punishment would stop those crimes, whereas, others think that we should focus more on other options to keep crime at a low rate. Hence, I would like to express my viewpoints along with a few real-time examples of this statement.<br><br>To begin with, Crimes are inevitable and devastating considering the present situations around the world. Firstly, If we assign a strong and the best punishment to those bad people, eventually others will think of that and stick to good rules. Secondly, This would remove those negative thoughts in their minds. Furthermore, as local law bodies are moving with such a critical punishment and this would bring a swift reduction in the crime rate. For Instance,  a few media news reports are updating the list of hard punishments with downsides to their family as well. As per Google's recent survey findings, 99% of committed criminals are changing their mindset to have a better life outside of prison.<br><br>However, undoubtedly, I strongly believe that this would make others very alert to whoever is there outside. In addition, this would be a message to the rest of the bad people who decided to do a crime.On the other hand, we can also change their mind by showing some values and relationships despite the longer prison sentences such as providing some training, coaching with good moral values and last but not  least, what are the advantages if we live like a good man in the society.<br><br>To sum up, no matter what kind of crime they committed,  there should be the best and longer punishment is much needed to avoid the unstoppable crime rate in the country."

    "title": "Many people say that universities should only offer places to young students with the highest marks, others say they should accept people of all ages, even if they did not do well at school. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "contents": [ "In this increasingly competitive society, more and more young people against each other to enrol in hall, which is considered as a symbol of success in study stage. However, some claim that universities should merely accept students with the flying colours academic results, while others believe that every student should be provided with equal opportunities to access tertiary discipline. I will discuss both sides and outline my personal opinion in the essay below.<br><br>Firstly, high school students with higher marks are far more deserved to enter institutes instead of dumb students who are always slow on the uptake and cannot get head nor tail of what the teachers are explaining. This is because students having a good memory, logical thinking and management skills should be fostered and study intensively into their aptitude fields, resulting in talented citizens who will contribute to the development of the national economy as well as scientific achievements in the future. Secondly, by offering academy study to solely a limited figure for students, professors and tutors can easily evaluate the students’ level of ability and skills during the teaching process, resulting in high-quality graduates. For example, National University of Medical, one of the most prestigious halls in Vietnam, only admit the top scorers in national university entrance exam in order to make sure that all recruiters are well-qualified and able to deal with a huge amount of specialized knowledge.<br><br>Nevertheless, many people debate that only accepting young, academically-gifted individuals is unfair to students who do not do well at school. The understandable reason is that performance at school does not reflect their potential to succeed at university. Thus, it is immoral to decline enrolling requests from some students, especially in this society where formal degrees are considered to be more essential than hand-on experience when it comes to recruitment. Moreover, offering higher schooling to high proportion of young people not only open up an equal change for students to have better career prospects in the future, but also help maintain a diverse community, where each student is valued and rewarded for their abilities.<br><br>In conclusion, although it seems to have many advantages to admit all students to the academy, I believe that university learning is only reserved for students with high marks.",
    "Higher education is known for its numerous advantages. It is argued that universities should only accept young students with the highest academic performance at school; however, from my own point of view, people of all ages should be accepted at universities despite their marks at school. This essay will examine both sides of the issue.<br><br>It is claimed that offering places in universities to only youngsters with the highest grades is better than accepting everyone. There is no doubt that higher educational institutes care about their reputation, therefore, they might only accept superior students, who will be able to study hard, and, consequently, gain more skills compared to students with low grades. Not only does this affect the university’s prestige, but it also guarantees that the student is not overloaded. If students with low educational standards enrol in a relatively difficult college, it will end up with failing the courses, so choosing students based on their grades might save them from failing. Even though these reasons might be convincing, it might sound unfair to some people. <br><br>Quite on the contrary, it is believed that students should all be given the same opportunities in spite of their age and school performance. The first advantage of accepting people of all ages is giving them another chance to continue their education. For instance, something might have prevented them from studying at a university when they were young, so offering them places in universities will help them gain the needed skills to improve their career prospects. A further benefit is avoiding the unfairness of classifying people according to their performance at school. Based on my own experience, school is not always fair. Some students; for example, might have not received the same quality of education as other, which means that they have not been given the opportunity to excel at school due to having poor teachers. <br><br>To conclude, offering places in universities for only those who achieved high marks at young ages should be stopped and equal chances should be given to everyone. This will allow all graduates to continue their higher education, which will improve the society in the future due to higher employment ra<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "There is no doubt that participating in sports comes along with numerous benefits. There are lots of opportunities for those who are enthusiastic about different fields of sport. In this regard, some opine that team sports are much better rather than individual plays. As far as I am concerned, there should be a balance between these two points of view, and none of them alone can lead to prosperity.<br><br>From one point of view, mankind lives in a community that is based on communication and relationships. Team sport could be an activity which gives a chance of building friendships with other players. For instance, football players not only play a game but also make strong bonds with each other since they learn how to trust and understand each other. Also, it is inevitable that group sports are much amusing compare to individual ones so being part of a team could encourage players to attend all games.<br><br>From another point of view, with the pressure coming from a hectic life, people prefer to spend some time alone. Taking into account this issue, individual sports like cycling and playing tennis help players focus on themselves. Also, these games not only increase their self-esteem but also have a good impact on their confidence because people start to believe in themselves when they reach success in games.<br><br>To sum up, I believe that neither participating in team sports nor individual ones can have a good impact on people because both of them have their own benefits in terms of well-being. Therefore, if there is a compromise or trade-off between these two sides, much better results can be anticipated.",
    "Doing sports has always been the best way to remain healthy and fit. However, there is a controversial argument that either solo or group sports are better. Personally, I believe that there is no privilege for none of them and each has its own benefits.<br><br>Taking part in sports which are played in teams would improve valuable virtues in players. Firstly, they learn to be a member of the team. In football, for example, all players try their best to have an excellent performance in harmony with others to win the game. They mostly support and help each other to grow. Secondly, the sense of compatibility would be boosted. They have to be flexible and compatible to play every role that a coach gives them. If players cannot obey and be in harmony with their peers, they will fail and lose the game. Finally, this kind of sport would positively affect the trustiness of people, because the team could not achieve its goal if the members do not trust each other.<br><br>By contrast, doing individual sports is likely to have a great impact on responsibility and independence. A person should work hard and be trained to be successful. In this case, a swimmer, for instance, needs to practice swimming for a long time to get  first place in Olympics. People who take part in this kind of sport should be fully responsible for their performance because they are playing alone and consequently will achieve exactly what they work for. They also need to rely on themselves instead of depending on teammates. Therefore, they may gain more confidence by winning every game due to their solo performance. <br><br>In conclusion, taking part in sports is more important than the type of that whether individual or in a team and in my opinion, both are favourable and benefit the attendees."

    "contents": [ "It has been argued by many that the government should not fund art as it is a sheer waste of resources as the money can be spent on the uplift of basic necessities of life, whereas others believe that spending on such activities is necessary to keep the values of a nation alive. In my opinion, I fully agree with the former belief that the humanity takes priority and the state should stop supporting fields like culture.<br><br>On the one hand, a huge amount is required for the uplift of cultural services and consumes a lot of the country's revenue. There is a strong vibe that this practice should be curbed and I also believe so. Firstly, the portion of the budget spent on the exhibitions can be used for the betterment of poor population. Secondly, the civic facilities can be improved if adequate amount is available to the rulers. Moreover, progress in the field of art has just an abstract value and don't generate any financial benefit, so it's better to invest in other sectors like the power generation, import and export, education and food supply. For instance, the same concept has been followed in true letter and spirit in many countries of the world like Thailand.<br><br>On the other hand, many intellectuals believe that the nations must keep their traditions alive by promoting their inherited values. Firstly, it will keep them connected to their past. Secondly, it will strengthen the bondage among the people. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the nation is being maintained by such activities. So, in order to maintain an integrity of a nation, it's thought that the economists must make plans for the upkeep of the folk activities. For example, the Turkish government is famous for its spending on traditional framework.<br><br>To conclude, I believe that in this era where poverty and other humanitarian crises are at their peak, it's obligatory for the lawmakers to give priority to such issues rather than spending on the music and fashion industry.",
    "It has been argued that few people think the government should not fund for arts as it is a sheer waste of money and many think in contrast. My opinion , I fully agree with the former belief as humanity takes precedence in priority. Arguments for the agreement and a counterargument are explained in detail below along with the conclusion.<br><br>Firstly , It is always fantastic to spend money to protect the cultural heritages, as it will stand high to reflect the tradition of our nation. Through these monuments , we preserve our culture as it speaks our history and it will help the next generation to understand the tradition and values. For example , India allocates a specific amount in each budget for maintaining these places. In addition , it will attract more tourists, who are enticed to visit other countries for understanding their values. As a ,result it will increase revenue to the nation through tourism.<br><br>Secondly, I strongly believe that there is no value in spending amount on these arts or culture as there are many problems related to humanity in the current era. Hunger  and poverty have not been eliminated in any country and I would say it surges each year . For Instance , in my country education has become costly , due to which many poor children are uneducated, as they could not afford school. So countries need to focus on eradicating poverty and concentrate on uplifting society.<br><br>To conclude , It is always fantabulous to preserve cultural values but this needs to be done after addressing the humanitarian crisis."

    "contents": [ "There is an undeniable fact that over a quarter of our population is behind the great technological wave. A group of people has blamed automation to be the core factor that led to the ever-widening social class distinctions while the others, on the contrary, believe that the achievements developed based on machinery could bring humans together. There are both pros and cons of these viewpoints that I will discuss in this essay.<br><br>As the individuals who are not able to adapt the changes will be left behind on the path of evolution, the lower-income earners will be the first targets to be lagging behind in the world dominated by the technological wave. On the economic front, the maximum-income figure estimated about one dollar per day is the biggest obstacle that restricts the poor to join the technological world since it takes them years to save enough money to buy a computer or a smartphone for their own. Besides, those who inhabit in remote areas or in less-developed countries are hardly have the opportunity to approach to technological innovations, or even worse, they virtually have no concept of the internet. Furthermore, humans are using technological devices, specifically smartphone, as a measure of our true values. For example, those who possess low-cost smartphones could feel less attractive than the others, or even could self-underestimate their core values just because they have yet afforded a famous brand-name phone. These realities are obviously the constraints of the technological applications available to us.<br><br>Conversely, machinery has a great potential capability to connect the world. It was a long path from Morse code to the internet for humans to speak the same language: the binary language. Driven by the function of the internet built on binary-based, we are brought together than ever before. For instance, people could easily capture the situation of an earthquake that occurred halfway around the earth only by surfing the internet. Furthermore, the sponsors could easily donate to these victims through internet banking account just by a click, even if they are cooking at home. Another influence of automation is to raise the empathy among people. For example, driven by the talent of media, a person could raise funds for a group of inhabitants who lived in the most remote area on earth by his presence on televised broadcast.<br><br>In conclusion, there are numerous reasons to share the concern that the gap among social classes would be widened by the rise of technological devices. I do, however, believe in a bright prospect that the more the automation could develop, the more human could empathize with each <br><br>",
    "Nowadays, the development of technology has increased rapidly and to a great extent that the whole world cannot survive without this. However, some people believe that the technology has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, while others argue that closeness between these people are growing. This essay discusses both the viewpoints.<br><br>On one hand, with the advancements in automation there are many things which cannot be afforded by various groups of people. For instance, the minimum cost of an iPhone is around 25000, which is not affordable by middle- and low-class people, while the affluent people can buy these products. However, apart from mobiles there are many medicines and treatments which could be costly, but the poverty-stricken people cannot pay for such drugs. Moreover, due to the advancements there are many impoverished people who are losing their lives, because the medication was not given within the correct time. For example, many young children in my country who are affected by deadly diseases are dying because they are poor and cannot pay high prices for their treatment.<br><br>On the other hand, this elevation in mechanization and computers has been a boon to all the classes of people who are living, because many top organisations whose primary priority are their customers rather than cost. Although, there are many electronic gadgets, medicines which has their prices in peaks, but there are other brands of products which are serving similar facilities to satisfy the people. For example, the internet cannot be afforded by many people, but the Wi-Fi which is available at railway stations, bus stops and also airports is very much helpful to the local public. <br><br>In conclusion, according to my viewpoint, the technology has broken the bridge between high -and low -class people to a great extent that presently all the people are enjoying all the facilities that they require."

    "contents": [ "Public transport has become a basic necessity in small as well as big cities. Many people believe that the governments should work on improving transport mediums and invest in rapid transport vehicles. In my opinion, I think every person wants affordable and comfortable journey so regulators must spend some budget amount to develop transport facilities. This essay will discuss, why some people think it is advantageous, and others not find it beneficial.<br><br>To start with, if faster public transport available, then people might prefer it rather than using their own vehicle which will eventually lead to less traffic in the city. To state an example, after Delhi metro inception in city, majority of Delhi's citizens have stopped using personal cars to travel instead now they use metro to reach their destination. Additionally, if less traffic is there in any city then pollution will be reduced. For example, significant improvement was observed in air quality when Delhi authorities had applied odd-even rule which was to ban even numbers car on even date and odd number cars on odd dates. Furthermore, rapid transport will reduce travel time, thus people's travelling to office will be hassle free.<br><br>Nevertheless, there are many compelling reasons why some people think that transport facility should not be given top priority by the authorities. Such people believe that other basic amenities like education, environment and medical should be the higher priority as they will affect the masses. And if better medical facilities are provided in government hospitals then people will not have to splurge their money in private hospitals. Similarly, education is one such area which should not be ignored.<br><br>In conclusion, the government should keep investing in this area to make transportation easily available and affordable while taking care of other departments too.",
    "In this modernisation era, transportation modes have turned the whole world into small villages. Presently, some masses assert that spending a significant amount on the fastest transportation modes is necessary. In contrast, others say that the government must use the money on other factors such as cost reduction and environmental conservation. Here. I would like to accord both viewpoints with my perception.<br><br>To begin with, it could be argued that providing citizens with faster forms of public transportation has brought about specific benefits. Firstly, more rapid forms of transport help people, particularly commuters, downsize travelling time to and from work. Therefore, people will have more leisure time, which will increase their work productivity. Secondly, people are less likely to be packed in cramped and hot buses by adopting the various modes of conveyance. As a result, one would not be in need to rush to get to work on time or get up so early to get a seat on a bus, and consequently, they will have more time to prepare before going to work or school or to enjoy their breakfast with their family.<br><br>Innumerable points can be mentioned to support the opposing view mentioned earlier. Initially, the government should spend money on the eco-friendly transport system. Specifically, excessive personal vehicle use reduces natural resources such as oil, fuel, and others, so it is imperative to make eco-friendly modes for people. Thus, more eco-friendly sources mean less traffic and less air contamination, which is fruitful for the environment. Moreover, in this inflation era, the government must deduce the transportation cost so that anyone can take public transport service and the prices of food and other necessities dependent on transport do not augment. Other than that, other crucial fields the government should focus on are healthcare, drinking water and education.<br><br>To reiterate, I believe that there are many long-term benefits of improved methods of transportation. Still, we cannot be oblivious to its impacts on cost and the environment."

While some believe that individual learning is the most appropriate learning approach, I would contend that collaborative learning method may have a beneficial impact on students' learning results. <br><br>To begin with, one advantage of studying alone is that students can pay full attention to their study materials. This is because they tend to be less distracted from learning by unnecessary conversations with their peers. Another benefit that individual learning approach can offer is that students are able to self-paced. For example, when studying in a group, it is true that a student with a limitation of intelligence may use more time than his or her peers to assimilate knowledge. Consequently, he or she may fall behind because of slow learning speed. In contrast, individual learning facilitates students to plan a study schedule that works best for them. <br><br>On the other hand, collaborations between students can offer them chances to learn valuable skills which may be useful to them in further future such as critical thinking, communication, and exchanging ideas. During group study, students will track their fellow students and debate with them if there is a point of contention. As a result, they will acquire in-depth knowledge about the particular topic they are discussing. Moreover, group study triggers students’ competitive with their peers, which motivates them to enhance their efficiency and productivity during the learning process. When facing a difficult problem in learning, they have a tendency to compete against their friends and try their best to solve that problem.<br><br>To sum up, although the advantages of the individual learning offer are concentration and self-paced schedule, I believe that group study is a more effective learning method as it helps students to hone their skills and triggers students’ competit<br><br>",
    "Many people are of the opinion that group study is a better way for students to learn, whereas, some think that it is more beneficial to read in isolation. The essay below will discuss on  both sides of the statement, as I will also highlight my personal view on the topic.<br><br>Firstly, to attain a study goal is something that is very challenging. Unless one is ready to be fully dedicated to studying, and avoid unnecessary distractions like parties and hangouts, it will never be achieved. This can be better handled when it is a personal decision that does not involve managing other people's choice about it. For instance, a joint reading target might not be met just because, some members decide to have fun rather than sticking to the plan. This can be very difficult to cope with.<br><br>On the other hand, coming together to learn and discuss by different individuals can be very helpful when all the parties involve are ready to give their best. During a collective lesson, people learn new ideas from others. Also, some faults or mistakes are corrected since it opens up an avenue for criticism and by so doing, a better result will be seen. A good example is a popular Scientist who was not able to pull through with his invention until he invited a few friends to his research who helped him to amend his wrongs and also brought in new ideas, which made it a success. If he didn't allow his colleagues in his work, maybe the project will still not be recorded as a successful one today.<br><br>In conclusion, there are positive aspects to both a group study and also a personal study as analysed in the essay. Although, both sides have good argumentative points, I  am very convinced that a group way of learning is still a better approach."

    "contents": [ "Globally, there are variable views regarding when children should begin formal education. A group of people believe that they should begin their education at an age of four years, while  others are of the view that they should commence their education at a much older age of seven or eight. I vehemently support the former view owing to its broader impact on the development and learning adaptability of children.<br><br>To begin with, those who are the proponents of children’s formal education at an older age, mostly support this view due to the fact that at an early age, children do not have the mental tendency to cope with the rigorous standards of today’s education system. This claim was substantiated by an article which was published in a leading European magazine, wherein it was mentioned that the child’s brain requires a minimum of six years in order to fully understand the taught subjects. Additionally, such groups of people are of the opinion that admitting children to school at a later stage would save the families from the hefty schooling expenses for a few years, which they have to incur. This view could be true for  countries belonging to a low-income category, with an exponentially expanding population. For instance, the economic experts of the most populous country, China, have stated that delaying early schooling drastically improves the average annual savings of a family<br><br>On the other hand, in some countries, it is highly recommended  that children  start early schooling. The roots of this view are embedded in the fact that at an early age,  children’s tendency to grasp  basic concepts, is at its peak. According to the research conducted by Oxford University, it has been observed that children who are admitted to schools at an early age outperform those admitted at a later age. Furthermore, as  children move away from the comfort of their homes, to learn at a younger age, they become more adaptable to the changing environment. This, in turn, inculcates in them the ability to respond to various situations at an early age. As per the official stats of an international kindergarten, it was observed that children admitted at an early age, showed greater interest in solving challenging tasks, set in different environments, as compared to the ones admitted at an older age.<br><br>To conclude, both opinions have their own support groups in different parts of the world. However, children should start their formal education at age 4 as it has a significant positive impact on their development and learning capabilities, which should not be undermined.",
    "While some individuals feel that children should engage in formal learning as soon as possible, some suggest they should not before the age of 7. Before coming to a final conclusion, I will discuss both of the ideas in the following essay.<br><br>To begin with, there are two leading reasons which can be the basis for the opinion providing youngsters with formal literacy. Firstly, according to some researchers, the younger a person is, the better their brain can be to gain and digest new knowledge. Parents want to take advantage of this period of time for their descendants to get access to the world of academics so that they will be well-prepared for higher education. Secondly, if children can acknowledge the importance of grades and self committing tasks, they can get competitiveness and autonomy. These two are one of the most admirable characteristics requested by most recruiters.<br><br>On the other hand, the 7 first years of a child can be considered essential for their growth both in mental and physical conditions. Initially, getting serious too soon in studying may lead to some health-related issues namely eye diseases, physical retardation, etc. Young children should have opportunities to take part in outdoor activities helping them develop their strength which can be useful for them in the future, facing long hard assignments. Another thing to mention, children’s minds are immature and naive. Dealing with pressure is not a good way for them to live through their childhood. They should be encouraged and have chances to experience art and music which can improve their creativeness and optimism.<br><br>In conclusion, in my opinion, the young should start schooling later because they can raise their cognitive capacities through play-based activities aside from academic learning. Too early education is at the same time at higher risk to lead to mental health problems which can outperform its ben<br><br>"

    "contents": [ "Time is the most precious thing we have nowadays. Individuals are travelling far for their work and education. I believe there are more disadvantages than advantages to this. This essay will discuss both the viewpoints.<br><br>On the one hand, there are people who argue that commuting greater distances is beneficial. They think one might read a book or listen to a podcast while travelling. I feel this can be done better at home, where you are relaxed, and more concentrated. This is because you are not distracted by traffic. For instance, while driving you have to pay attention to cars and pedestrians. Furthermore, when a person is multitasking while driving, the chances of accidents increases. In contrast, if a person is paying full attention to only driving, the probability of any mishap decreases.<br><br>On the other hand, spending more time travelling wastes a lot of time. This is because an average person spends a couple of hours commuting. For example, if someone's school or workplace is 20KM away. It takes around an hour driving. This time could have been spent on more important things like spending time with your family. In addition, if you save this time, you get more to do things that matters like working or studying.<br><br>To conclude, having your work closer to your home has more positives than negatives. You can enjoy life more by saving crucial time, and being safe on the road by not getting distracted. As a result, you are saving money because time is money these days.",
    "In this day and age ,more and more people are spending a lot of time  travelling to different places such as work or school. Many claims that this could be a detrimental development. However ,some people opine that they have some benefits. In my ,opinion, I believe that this situation could have some negative expansion.<br><br>Firstly ,in my ,view, the detrimental of having to commute longer to work or school are conspicuous. For ,example, when the public exploits transport systems and cars to travel to their destination they create a lot of air pollution. This would be a noticeable danger for humans. Also ,environmental problems have been increasing. This could definitely be a dire situation for arriving at people's destination. Therefore , this makes it clear why some people have an opposite opinion for this circumstance and believe that there could be a negative. <br><br>Secondly ,the benefits of a longer commute to work or school are multiple. For instance ,humans who decide to use public transport system can have more personal time for their leisure activities such as ,reading books ,listening to music and conducting activities separate from work or education. This would help them to achieve energy to stay at the workplace and education centre and do their assignment. As a result ,it becomes apparent that spending time  travelling to work or school could not be without distinctive and positive reasons. <br><br>To summarise ,the two sides of the argument are concerning the prospect of spending time to travel different places that humans want to go have strong support. However ,after a thorough analysis of both sides ,I strongly believe that this could be negative and would have some drawbacks. It is predicted that the problems of the trend will continue to increase in the near f<br><br>"

    "title": "Some people think that cultural traditions may be destroyed when they are used as money-making attractions aimed at tourists. Others believe it is the only way to save these traditions. Discuss on both sides and give your opinion.",
    "contents": [ "There is a heated debate that has been sparked all over the world. Some believe that the action that has been done to get tourists can destroy the traditional culture of the country. On the other hand, it is argued that this method is the key to saving traditions too. This essay will discuss both ideas including my perspective. <br><br> First of all, as the advancement of technology is increasing day by day, it is  easier to travel around the world despite the time or cultural differences. In addition, the number of people who would like to make money with tourist visitors raise rather than before. Besides, The majority of people are focusing on getting money and are unaware of destroying culture. For example, thousands of ancient pagodas and historical buildings in Bagan, Myanmar are being wrecked by money-maker. In order to get tourist attractions, some of them are replaced with modern buildings and theme parks. <br><br>In contrast, it is suggested that it is the only way to save culture from being disappeared. This is because if people are not making renovations to old buildings and other traditional things, they are more likely to collapse by the damage of natural disasters. What is more, by doing this action, tourists will be more interested in our cultures as well as getting more dollars. Therefore, it can be a win-win situation.<br><br>To sum up, from my point of view, activities to persuade tourists can destroy cultures and it is not the only way to save since there are many effective ways to keep our tradition without negative ef<br><br>",
    "Many people hold a view that the government's use of money-making attractions aimed at tourists contributes to the destruction of others, believing it is a way to save traditions. In this essay, I will elaborate on both sides and then state my position.<br><br>On the first hand, the reason people state that traditional customs are damaged because of commercialization is that means many people have changed many old-fashioned places to make them more suitable and convenient for many visitors. For example, to make it comfortable for tourists in the process of venturing and visiting some big mountains, they build many suspension cables on the way from the ground to the mountain. Had it not been for misplaying the wild landscapes, it would not have the tradition of historical monuments. <br><br>On the second hand, others hold that earning money from cultural tradition is a solution to save that culture. Because the government will have expenditure for keeping many historic monuments. In particular, the tourists pay money for visiting many tourist attractions, and those fees will be spent on keeping and repairing cultural traditions. A good example of it is Cu Chi Tunnels, the visitors spend money for buying tickets to visit inside, and that fee is a tool for the government to repair the tunnels. Besides that, Dong Ho folk painting still exists to this day because of the money from selling their paintings to the tourists who visit Dong Ho village. Without money, people will not have the financial resources to maintain the traditions.<br><br>To conclude, some argue that using tradition as a money-making attraction has a part to destroy it. Meanwhile, others believe in preserving cultural traditions. In my opinion, I concur with the latter n<br><br>"

    "title": "Some people think that zoos are all cruel and should be closed down. Others however believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.",
    "contents": [ "It is currently easy to find a zoo as there are many of them around the world. However, it is doubtable if they treat animals well or just want to make money out of it. As it is hard to be known, should a place be trusted to protect wildlife in danger or not? Let's analyse both points and I'll give my point of view to conclude it.<br><br>On the one hand, it is possible to find sanctuaries which usually claim to have the duty of caring for injured pets and afterwards place them back to nature. Although, when some animal suffers an injury as being hit by a car for example, and not completely recover from this, it consequently cannot survive if left into the jungle. Moreover, take the risk of getting into another accident. <br><br>On the other hand, there is a range of zoos with a business purpose only. Sadly, in this case, animals are just a kind of attraction. Allegations of mistreatment, lack of hygiene and bad living conditions are unfortunately common about these venues. They pretend to treat creatures fairly when public come to visit, but that might be totally the opposite while no one is seeing this.<br><br>To sum up, briefly, the pros and cons are easily found in keeping those places opened. Even though knowing some of them just have the intention to help, there are still others taking advantage of it through bad treatment, and that is the reason why I truly believe the government should shut zoos down and take full responsibility of watching and caring for wil<br><br>",
    "The protection of animals became an important topic for a longer period of time because of deforestation and hunting. These creatures play a crucial role in our ecosystem. In order to protect them, zoos are built by authorities but some people are of the view that they are not good for their well-being and should be shut down. On the other hand, others say that they are helpful. However, according to ,me zoos are beneficial for wildlife. In the following ,paragraphs I will discuss both views as well as my opinion.<br><br>The masses who are against shelters are because of cages. Birds are kept inside cages. The public thought that they are meant to be free. They will lose the power of flying. Thus, citizens demand  their independence. Another reason is they are used for entertainment purposes. Elephants, birds, and Monkeys are trained by staff  so that they can earn money from them. They may be bitten by them to give  perfection in the shows. Therefore, they should be out of these cruel places. For instance, a report posted in the news shows that animals are mentally and physically tortured by parks which slows down their reproduction ability hence, life span is not safe inside.<br><br>On the other hand, there are some advantages too, First of ,all the Protection of the eco-system. Hunters are killing the inhabitants for business purposes or for eating. Which means a loss to their life cycle. Some of the mammals are at endanger of extinction. Thus, these places will assist to save them. Moreover,   Due to  industrialization, trees are cut down, their living places are all ruined. As a result. they came out and entered into the cities hence, road accidents and risk to people increased because of wild animals such as lions and tigers. According to a study by environmentalists, various creatures are saved after the end of \"Dudo\". Recently, Pandas' was at risk, but according to the report, now they are at lower risk. <br><br>To sum up, Safari parks are proven beneficial, so that they can protect wildlife in the fast-paced era, so government should put more steps to improve the ser<br><br>"
