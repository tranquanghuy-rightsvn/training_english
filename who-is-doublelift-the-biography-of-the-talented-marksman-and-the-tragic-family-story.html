<strong>Who is Doublelift?</strong><br><br>Doublelift has long been a familiar name to the League of Legends community worldwide. As a talented marksman player for Counter Logic Gaming (CLG), he has participated in the World Championship Finals of this game five times, with his highest achievement being third place in 2015. Known for his aggressive playstyle and "carry" mentality, he has been regarded as one of the best marksmen in the game's history. Few know that his life has been a tragic drama stemming from the strict and harsh upbringing typical of Asian parenting. Today, let's review Doublelift's life with 3000vocab.<br><br> <strong>The biography of the talented marksman</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>Doublelift's real name is Yiliang Peng, born on July 19, 1993, a U.S. citizen with Chinese heritage. As the second of three siblings, he grew up with his parents and siblings in the U.S. and knew little about his cultural roots. However, due to his parents' Chinese background, they always wanted their children to be educated under Chinese values, prioritizing academics and restricting Western concepts like love, socializing, parties, and especially electronic games, which were strictly prohibited.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJamhuYVdRNkx5OTFibWwzWldKemFYUmxMMEZqZEdsMlpWTjBiM0poWjJVNk9rSnNiMkl2T0RJM1AyVjRjR2x5WlhOZmFXNEdPZ1pGVkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYXR0YWNoYWJsZSJ9fQ==--9bfd7ccf46fe9ef2bd94deb59b6c64427c9c26e0" content-type="image/png" url="http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBanNEIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ea220c07e843d542d9616158cde59e0388fa2447/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="229795" width="651" height="357" previewable="true" presentation="gallery"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--png">

  <figcaption class="attachment__caption">
  </figcaption>
</figure></action-text-attachment><br><br><strong>Passion for gaming</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>Under the strict education of his parents, his older brother, Yihong Peng, grew up as a well-behaved child, always obedient and following the predetermined path to becoming an engineer or doctor, esteemed professions in society. Not disappointing his parents' expectations, Yihong Peng graduated early from a prestigious medical school and became a doctor at a private hospital near home. In contrast, Doublelift was the epitome of a rebellious child, breaking the rigid molds set by his parents. At the age of 6, he was introduced to the electronic game Warcraft by his brother, and to everyone's surprise, he defeated a difficult boss in the game on his first try, a feat that took Yihong a week to accomplish. This sparked Doublelift's love for electronic games. Despite being frequently prohibited by his parents, Doublelift secretly played electronic games and considered it a passion. Recognizing his younger brother's talent, Yihong often covered for him to avoid their parents' punishment.<br><br><strong>Conflict with parents</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>A turning point came in 2011 when Doublelift was invited to participate in a professional tournament in Australia by a team. However, his parents vehemently disagreed, fearing that their son would be deceived or fall victim to organ trafficking. It took a week of persuasion by Yihong and Doublelift to finally convince their parents, who reluctantly agreed at the last minute before his flight. The tournament was a resounding success for Doublelift and his team, finishing second overall, with Doublelift pocketing a $30,000 prize. However, this success did not change his parents' perception of electronic games. Upon returning home, his parents did not congratulate him but instead stated that it was the last time they allowed him to participate in an electronic game tournament.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJamhuYVdRNkx5OTFibWwzWldKemFYUmxMMEZqZEdsMlpWTjBiM0poWjJVNk9rSnNiMkl2T0RJNFAyVjRjR2x5WlhOZmFXNEdPZ1pGVkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYXR0YWNoYWJsZSJ9fQ==--e45631315a29cba6ccc4d5b56db5d7112f5adc2f" content-type="image/png" url="http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBandEIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--0399eff84f1d339f75e5fb581a64a42c80e5a0d7/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="422111" width="653" height="433" previewable="true" presentation="gallery"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--png">

</div>
<div>In 2012, Doublelift was recruited by Counter Logic Gaming, his current team, with a lucrative salary offer. However, his parents were adamant that he either choose university education or leave home with his electronic gaming passion. Doublelift chose to follow his heart's calling.<br><strong><br>Reconciliation</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>During this period, Doublelift achieved great success, consistently ranking high in national tournaments, participating in prestigious World Championship events, gaining the admiration of the gaming community, and appearing actively on television. However, his parents still did not appreciate these accomplishments. In an interview at the end of 2015, Doublelift broke down in tears, revealing that his parents had completely cut off contact since he moved out and expressed a desire to reconcile with them. He regretted his past choices and was willing to trade his current glory and wealth for a happy family life. This video was shared with his parents and brother, and through Yihong's relentless efforts over a month, Doublelift finally reconciled with his parents, who accepted him back into their home.<br><br><strong>Tragedy strikes</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>If the story ended here, Doublelift's life would have been truly fulfilling with a beautiful ending, and no one would call it a tragedy. However, beneath the calm surface lies hidden waves waiting to rise. In 2020, while participating in the World Championship, Doublelift received shocking news that his parents had been murdered in their home. The police apprehended the perpetrator, who was none other than his brother, Yihong. It was believed that Yihong had long been dissatisfied with his parents' strictness but had always been obedient. The effort to suppress emotions led Yihong to gradually fall into depression, both in his personal life and career. A turning point occurred when his girlfriend of 10 years broke up with him, plunging him into a severe crisis. This was the breaking point that unleashed the beast within him. One evening at his home, a dispute at the dinner table led Yihong to pull out a gun and repeatedly shoot at those who had given him life. Forensic examination also concluded that Yihong showed signs of mental illness.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJamhuYVdRNkx5OTFibWwzWldKemFYUmxMMEZqZEdsMlpWTjBiM0poWjJVNk9rSnNiMkl2T0RJNVAyVjRjR2x5WlhOZmFXNEdPZ1pGVkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYXR0YWNoYWJsZSJ9fQ==--d1f8795f773386f76ab144122e9651d56befa6a3" content-type="image/png" url="http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBajBEIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--0d453b51b28229bfed0f5a6317192d9eda4b462a/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="312580" width="652" height="424" previewable="true" presentation="gallery"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--png">

</figure></action-text-attachment><br><strong><br>Retirement and Comeback</strong><br><br>
</div>
<div>In just one day, Doublelift lost two loved ones, and his beloved brother became the perpetrator, a shock that even the strongest could not bear. That season, he had to abandon his career to return home for the necessary procedures and funerals. Despite receiving warm inquiries, condolences, and encouragement from fans worldwide, he announced his retirement from professional gaming a few months later.<br><br>
</div>
<div>After years of dedication to his career as a gamer and streamer, he has amassed a vast fortune in both achievements and material wealth. He lives with his girlfriend in a luxurious mansion in the U.S. and livestreams his gaming activities daily. On his live streams, he rarely shares sad stories from the past and seldom mentions his imprisoned brother. In 2023, he announced his return to professional gaming with his familiar team, Counter Logic Gaming, becoming the oldest professional gamer to date. This news quickly garnered enthusiastic attention from fans worldwide.<br><br>
</div>
<div>Through Doublelift's story, it is hoped that a message of living freely will reach Asian parents with strict and traditional mindsets. Wishing Doublelift to overcome his family tragedy and continue to succeed on the path he has chosen.<br><br>
